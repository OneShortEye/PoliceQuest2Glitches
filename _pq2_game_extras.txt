              - Police Quest II is Copyright 1988 Sierra On-Line -

"Police Quest II: A well-thought out adventure game created by Sierra Online.
(At least by what we would define as well-thought out when we consider titles
such as moon logic King's Quest and horny logic Leisure Suit Larry). You, the
player, assume the role of Sonny Bonds, a veteran police officer and recently
promoted detective of the Lytton PD. A year has passed since Sonny brought down
the famous Death Angel (who was really just an overrated drug pusher that had a
mancrush for blonde pimps), hooked up with his favourite prostitute, I mean,
girlfriend Marie Wilkans, and was enjoying life... Then, Bains broke out of
jail to ensure another Police Quest game was created.  Way to go Bains. You
helped Jim Walls score another hard-earned paycheque.

Generally well-received and liked (as far as Police Quest games go), we
suggested that SQH denizen Kuro-chan should have 'fun' while playing this game.
Well.. that was a mistake, because he broke the fuck out of it!"


----------------------------------- UPDATES -----------------------------------

May 4th, 2025 (1.002)
- It's just easier to say: More stuff was added and more stuff was fixed.
- Ammended the list of which games the issues work on by adding an Atari ST
  column... Then later removed it because Atari ST is pretty much the same as
  the DOS version, both the 1.001.006 and 1.002.011 builds.

April 30th, 2025 (1.001)
- Made some updated to the concept for BUGS and other odds and ends to show
  what versions this applies to.

April 18th, 2025
- I see updates...

April 7th, 2025.
- More updates...  and more.  Gage keeps finding stuff for me to do, huh...?

April 6th, 2025
- Tons of updates.  In a way, it feels a bit like a new document.

April 2nd, 2025
- Fixed typos, made comments more consistent.
- Updated motel and airport entrance, airport bathroom  information.

March 31st, 2025
- Moved a bug from 061 to 062 (where it belongs)
- Added "Inifinte Points" glitch and "Missing Points" to 061.

March 2nd, 2025
- First major draft completed.


----------------------------- GENERAL INFORMATION -----------------------------

- This is aimed at lesser-known details. Generic content that is normally
  covered in walk-throughs or is considered common knowledge will not be
  deliberately mentioned. It is possible gamers may already know about some (if
  not all) of the contents of this document.
- The document divides up the content by rooms. Room data will contain may
  contain:
  - Commentary on lesser known commands
  - Bugs which can include unusual animations, soft locks, hard locks, total
    breaks and other stuff the player can go out of their way to accomplish.
- Kuro-chan is responsible for finding most of content. Gage Holston
  contributed a good-size amount to this document, as well. A few entries were
  also found by others such as Space Quest Historian and Sierra Arts (Full list
  is at the bottom of the document), but further research was conducted on them
  (such as which versions had the glitch, additional in-game consequences,
  etc.).
- For some reason, 'dos' is a swear word.  Obviously, the development team
  missed making games for Apple computers.
- You can (sometimes) answer with affirmative / y for yes and n / negative for
  no.
- debug mode may be required for a few of the more unique gltiches, crashes and
  other problems in order to see what happens under some more unique
  circumstances.  To use it, press both shift keys and the minus key on the
  numeric keypad
- 'kiss angel of death' can enter an unofficial debug mode that gives the
  player the ability to manipulate certain odds and ends like inventory and
  teleporting to another room.
  - For J1.000.052, you can still type in 'kiss angel of death', but it appears
    all the keys are routed through the CTRL key, instead of ALT (which is used
    for katakana, it seems)
  - Do not use the room teleport while a script is auto-running, or else
    it will lock the game up, leaving only menu access open.


---------------------------- DIFFERENT SOUND JINGLE ---------------------------

- There is an unused sound track which the JP version of the game uses when the
  player scores points. In the resource files, it's sound.049


-------------------------------- DRIVER TIMERS --------------------------------

- First countdown starts at 700 seconds and gradually goes down to 1. When you
  enter Homicide (while it's at 1), the 1st assignment gets triggered and the
  counter is set to 300 seconds (which is already counting down while the
  captain gives you your orders (By the time he's done talking, you'll have
  lost nearly 15 seconds).

- This timer can be sped up in two ways:
  - Driving around in your vehicle accelerates how quickly this depletes.
    Due to how the game treats the personal car over the unmarked car during
    disciplinary action, this only resets the 1st timer,
  - Sighting your gun and collecting the field kit sets the value to 1.
    Useful for speedruns, but demolishes low score runs.

- Each of these events will set the timer to 5 minutes, giving the player that
  much in-game time to get there.
  - Go to Jail
  - Go to Mall
  - Go to Cotton Cove
  - Return to Cotton Cove (IF you pursued Bains)
  - Go to Warehouse **

  ** Warehouse one is a little different. Day 2 starts with a 10-minute
     countdown to give the player enough time to get into the Homicide office
     where the captain gives his orders to get your butt down to the Warehouse,
     THEN the 5-minute counter starts.
     Honestly, it does not matter how long it takes for Sonny to get in the
     office; it is not like he can go anywhere with the Sonnymobile and the
     timer can go all the way down to 1 without consequence.

- When the game first boots up, the driver timer set to 700 and counts down the
  same way as starting a new game.

- Driving anywhere (in the Sonnymobile) while a timer is counting down will
  cause the timer to greatly accelerate.
  There are also instances (notably Cotton Cove and Warehouse) where getting
  into the Sonnymobile will knock the regular timer down to 3, which will
  quickly expire the existing timer, landing the player in serious
  trouble as soon as they try to do anything else in the game. If this is still
  on the first timer, the second timer will be set to 600, though this will be
  updated after some 'quality time' with the captain.

- If you wish to maniuplate the driver timers to see some unique glitches and
  bugs, do the following:
  - Enter debug mode (double-shift and minus on the far right side). This will
    pause the game, so do not feel rushed during this.
  - Press G for global variables
  - Type in 158 for the 1st variable and set it to 0.
  - Press G for global variables
  - Type in 159 for the 2nd variable and set it to 0.
  - Enter double-shift + D to exit debug mode and resume your game.

- If you set both global variables to 0, the game will ignore the timers and
  let you proceed to where you are going, unhindered.


---------------------------------- INVENTORY ----------------------------------

- What flowers Sonny has purchased at the airport will show up differently in
  inventory.
- The checkmark on the hit list is ... backwards?


------------------------------- NAME SUBSTITUTES ------------------------------

office       barn
field kit    briefcase
marie        cheeks
toilet       crapper


-------------------------------- OUT OF BOUNDS --------------------------------

Several rooms in Police Quest II will attempt to return the player back to the
screen if they attempt to walk out of bounds.  There is a certain distance the
game will use to force the player back to the screen before the automatic
redirect ends.

During normal movement, the player will move 3 units left/right when going
straight, 2 units up/down and 2 units in both the x & y direction, depending
on which way the player is traveling. This means Sonny moves a bit faster when
going straight left or straight right.

In order to glicth the out-of-bounds setup, the player must execute the auto-
return and manage to not cross back into the threshold. A lot of this will
depend on if there is something that can prevent the player from returning
to the normal area. Usually something that can block the path (for instance,
a vehicle on the road). Each room handles this different from others, so
some it is possible to clip around a room and end up on the other side (due
to how integers wrap around when you continue to increase / decrease the value.
There are rooms, however, where it is possible to be stuck in a permanent
message loop because the player cannot break out of the restraints of the
return script. Again, this is all depending on which room this happens in, but
the game may require a complete system reset, depending on if the player can
break out of the endless textbox spawning.

It is easiet to exploit this if the game is set to slow speed, which makes it
easier for the game to register the rapid pressing of whichever direction the
player wishes to go.

The game 'appears' to respond to the numeric keypad a lot better than the arrow
key setup (This could simply be a matter of perception, but it does seem to
break the game more efficiently).

The following list applies to all screens with some sort of redirect for an
attempt to go out of bounds:

* Given that the game is constantly forcing the player to move +1 along the x-
  axis, it is impossible to get back into the map.

** Motel Parking Lot also makes sure your y-value cannot exceed 132, making it
   impossible to clip around.

Marie's House and Police Station both have a built in game over when the
Y-position reaches a certain value beyond the bottom of the screen.

A curious bug happens where if the player's Y-position exceeds 25000, the
X-positon will also start to climb up, albeit slowly.


------------------------------- COMMON GLITCHES -------------------------------

KEITH COCKLOCKS YOU

- This works when the player tries to walk outside the bounds of the screen.
  After being given some text about how Sonny will return, the player will
  automatically walk back in. However, if Keith is directly behind the player
  when this happens, Sonny is prevented from returning to the screen which
  forever locks the player in a textbox cycle.
- Most of the time, the only way out of this is to kill the program. If this
  is played this on an old system powered by DOS, this will require a system
  reboot.
- It may be easier to perform this glitch by killing the game speed down to
  minimum. Much of the time, you need Keith in a pixel-perfect position so
  Sonny can go around him (if it applies), get to the wall that automatically
  walks you back into the room so you can get him locked in place.

INFINITE POINTS
- The most common type of infinite points is to collect evidence that will not
  be removed from a scene (yet or ever, depending on the situation), allowing
  the player to return to the station, book the evidence, then return to the
  scene of the crime to collect it again).

Common locations include:
- Burt Park > Accosting the mugger with your walkie talking while being close
              to the screen edge so Keith does not have enough time to catch
              him.
            > Clipping through the scene to reach the sewer entrance after
              using the walkie talkie to chase off the mugger.
- Mall > Get the print from the car.
- Airport > Get the print from the car.
- Marie's House > Get the print from the ashtray.
- Motel Room 108 > Get the envelope.



MOONWALKING

- To perform this, the player must press a directional key as the game loads
  between the in- vehicle screen and the location screen as Sonny gets out of
  the car. If done right, the player will start to move in a direction,
  regardless of which way he is facing, which can result in an unusual
  'moonwalking'-like appearance.
- Depending on location, the player may or may not clip through walls.
- Alternatively, there are a instances where the instructions for how to
  perform this bug will be stated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   LOCATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The usual layout is as follows:

- General notes about the map, perhaps some extra odds and ends the players
  may not be familiar with.
- COMMANDS: Some unusual or unexpected commands the player can enter.
- BUGS: Stuff that causes weird events, glitches, soft and hard locks to
        happen.
- ODD CODING: This is for events or content that do not hurt the game, but
              can produce some unexpected / unusual results.
- LEFTOVER BITS: Stuff that had potential to be used, but simply was not...
- FOR FUN: While not intentional, on rare occasions, something can happen in-
           game that has proven to be unexepectedly entertaing. This does not
           include the number of times Keith's poor pathfinding can cause the
           player to wait a considerable amount of time on the screen.

Non-Room Specific Comments/Observations

Air Tank
- If the player uses debug to set global 191 to 32768 while underwater, they
  will have unlimited air.
- Player loses 11 air when they get the "low on air" warning (The 52 jumps
  straight to 39, instead of 50).
- Player loses 8 air when they get the "out of air" warning (17 jumps to 7,
  instead of 9). Game over happens immediately after.

Bouyancy, Much?
- Buoyancy is spelled with an "ou" instead of "uo" which is 'technically' still
  right, though it is used less often. The parser allows for both spellings when
  getting the belt in the van.
- This applies to all versions of the game.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-Room Specific Bugs/Issues

Fail to Set Driver Timer               1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X       X       X       X       X
- After completing the game's start up and the player is given orders to go to
  jail, the player has the option to glitch out the driving timer so it will
  stay at zero until the next objective is set. (Normally) what is supposed to
  happen is if the driver timer ever hits 1, either Hall goes on the radio or
  Sonny gets pulled over by a cruiser while on the road. While this setup works
  well for the unmarked car, PQ2 neglected to include code for Sonny's vehicle.
  IF the player runs out of time while in Sonny's personal vehicle (called the
  Sonnymobile in this reference), it does not get set to a new value and both
  timers are left at 0, allowing the player to take their time and do whatever
  they want until they complete the current objective/scenario.
- This does not work when VAR 100 is set to 5 (Cotton Cove Scenario) and 10
  (Warehouse scenario). What happens instead is the current timer is set to
  3 and 'if' the player is still running off the first driver timer, then the
  second one is set to 600. The second one will be updated with the proper
  timer
- This does not work at the start of the game. Even if the player exhausts the
  timer, the driver timer is set to 300 when VAR 100 is set to 1, so you will
  always have a timer when the main part of the game gets underway. On the
  plus side, this means that it is not possible to get in trouble when using
  this exploit to speed up getting orders.

Open Wallet                            1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X       X
- Player can type 'Open Wallet' to get a description of the wallet that
  includes Sonny's badge. The problem is, this can be performed regardless of
  whether or not the player has obtained the wallet.

The Driving Music Follows You          1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X       X       X       X       X
- The player can interrupt the tail end of the unmarked vehicle driving
  sequence by entering F4 / 'open door' as Keith and dispatch radio their final
  confirmation of where you are driving to. This has the added effect of
  continuing the driving music playing in the background.

Who Needs a Vest?                      1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X       X       X       X       X
- This is more theory than an actual bug, but there is an issue with the code
  where the air consumption while navigating Cotton Cove's river is almost
  unaffected by wearing the Buoyancy Control Vest (BCV, vest, etc.).
- The players starts with 2200 units of air (assuming they picked the correct
  tank, otherwise, it's going to be a very short dive). We can remove:
  - 92 units for the time needed to reach the bottom of the river.
  - 11 units for the low air warning (Do not ask why they did this, it is part
    of the code; perhaps, they had an issue with the condition check there).
  - 7 units for when the air reaches near-zero (Yes, they kill the player
    before it reaches zero).
  Based on a normal game speed of 6, which works out to around 10 frames per
  second, that gives the player 1 minute, 44.5 seconds before they completely
  run out of air and get a game over. However, since most players (typically)
  do not play Police Quest II 'that' slow, they will have far less time to get
  all the points. To further complicate the short amount of time available,
  much of this time will be spent moving againt the current to get one piece of
  evidence.
- The left-side river screen has a different air consumption rate. This is
  likely due to the importance of this screen and the extra steps required to
  uncover the evidence, here.
  - 4 units every 3 frames without the vest. (1.333 per frame, average)
  - 4 units every 6 frames with the vest. (0.667 per frame, average)
  This is where the vest benefits the player.
- The given speculation is that the air consumption (on the middle and right
  screens) is based on not wearing the vest, which barely leaves enough time
  for the player to go straight to the three objectives and do what is needed.
  The normal (with vest) air consumpton would likely be 1 per frame, which
  would leave the player 3 minutes, 33.6 seconds, a far more respectable time
  to conduct a 'proper' exploration of the bottom of the river. This also leads
  to the right side of the screen being 1/3 slower than normal.

  NOTES:
  * With the right screen, they use a == for the frame counter to make sure
    the value was 0 before they reduced air value. The middle and left screens
    used a >=, meaning they ignored any checks for a frame counter and deducted
    the value per frame.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.001 -- Station, Outside

- The game starts you off with no flags set (aside from whatever 'starts' the
  game), 0 points and a 700-second countdown before the captain gives you your
  first orders. This timer is automatically set to 0 after the gun has been
  sighted and the field kit has been collected. If the player is worried they
  may not have enough time to earn all the possible points at the station
  before the timer runs out, consider doing those two events last. The next
  timer only starts AFTER the player walks back into Homicide and gets his
  orders from the captain.
- The flag does not animate in the JP version of the game.
- If the player waits long enough on this screen without any keys, a message
  will pop up having Sonny ask himself, "Now where are my keys?".
- 'Get naked' produces a dialogue response without a game over.  This only
  works in 1.001.000 and 1.001.006. However, 'Remove clothes' appears to
  work in all versions.  'piss' also produces a similar result.

** COMMANDS:
- look time
- salute flag
- look mirror
- get naked, remove clothes
- take piss

** BUGS:
Moonwalking                            1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- The player will walk and respond to anything that blocks Sonny's path.
- Both vehicles are affected by this in 1.001.000. By 1.001.006, this is
  restricted to Sonny's personal vehicle.

** ODD CODING:
Lock THIS!                             1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- The player can unlock the door, retreat before the door is open and the door
  remains unlock, DESPITE dialogue saying it automatically locks when closed.

Nosey Fence                            1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- The player can walk diagonally along the fence opening that leads to the
  street (bottom fo the screen). By hugging the fence edge, the player can walk
  diagonally up or down towards the fence and the player will still move
  vertically. Normally, a path block should stop player movement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.002 -- Station, Main Hallway

- One of the rare, few instances where nothing is broken or unexpected commands
  are found.
- Booking the hit list and business card allows the player to skip the
  conversation with the captain regarding leads on where to go next.

- The y-position for dealing with the field kit locker spans across the height
  of the narrow hallway. Given how little room there is to navigate, it is not
  'that' large a range. More interesting is the player does not have to face
  the direction of the locker to open it.

pic.003 -- Station, Narcotics

- There are plenty of words that can be used to earn points and interfere
  with an internal investagtion regarding Lloyd's druge use. Some of these
  work together better than others. These (appear to) include:

  verb1:  chat, converse, interrupt, speak, talk, ask, inquire, request
  verb2:  cocaine, dope, drug, narcotic, complaint, difficulty, problem,
          trouble, investigation

  This also requires the player has been on the computer, access the personnel
  folder and bring up Lloyd's file.
- The cabinet in the back can give you access to the narcotics files, which
  happen to include Don Colby's address (even though it's listed as classified
  on the computer... Seriously, was anyone paying attention when they put
  this game together?!)
- You can say a LOT of different things to Kim Walters, even some odd words,
  like "(Kiss, fuck, hug, get, touch, take, steal, *many other words) + woman".
  Each response just rolls off her.
- Talking to Steve will allow him to recite one of his many poetry entries
  that he made up. You can also ask for a poem (No, please don't. Seriously,
  don't do it).
- You can ask Lt. Dooley for help accessing the cabinet or computer, if you
  want.

- When asking / talking to someone in the room, if you do not use a specific
  name (Dooley, Kim, Lloyd, Steve), you will get a "You're not close enough."
  response, rather than something that better describes reality, like, there is
  no one by that name in the room.

pic.004 -- Station, Homicide

- If you fail to hang up your keys after you are done your shift, the captain
  will instruct you to leave the keys on his desk. This process will repeat if
  you go back in to recover the keys.
- 'look score' saves a step when examining the bulletin board.
- 'Open drawer' works in the JP version of the game. The other versions require
  'Unlock drawer' to gain access.
- The 'letter' in the drawer is also called a note in 1.001.000 and 1.001.006.
- If you show up at the office between going to the hotel and going to Marie's,
  the Captain will comment on what happened at the hotel and what Bains may be
  after.
- At the start of Day 2, the captain directs Sonny to the warehouse. During
  this, the driver timer (Global158) is set to 300 in 1.001.000 and 600 in
  all other versions.
- After the Captain is made aware of Marie's kidnapping, if you bring up (or
  show) the hit list, the Captain will give you directions on what to do. If
  you have gathered enough evidence at the motel, he will direct you to chase
  down Colby before Bains kills him (which is where the idea of going to
  Steelton sorta comes from). Otherwise, he tells you to continue
  investigating. The funny part is:
  - In 1.001.000, you need the Hit list AND/OR the business card to 'convince'
    the game that you have gathered enough evidence so you can book a flight.
    Specifically, both are not required.
  - In 1.001.006 and all proceeding versions, the hit list AND business card
    are required. If the player speaks to the Captain with only one in-hand
    and not (at least) booked the other one, this will soft lock the game;
    giving evidence to the captain does not update that it was booked. The
    captain will only update Global 100 to 13 (Fly to Steelton) if both
    pieces of evidence pass his inspection.
    To get through this part, the player must:
    - Already have booked both pieces of evidence (You can skip this entire
      section if you did that).
    - Book one piece and give the captain the other.
    - Give the captain both pieces at the same time.
  Giving the captain the hit list / card also removes it from your inventory,
  preventing the player from achieving a full score.
- "Your partner, Keith Robinson, is an easy-going veterin detective"...

                                         X
- If the player attempts to book Colby's business card as evidence, the captain
  will behave as though Bains has no idea where Colby is. The only way to
  convince him is to present the card, yourself. Fortunately, it does impact
  global 100's update to 13, which allows the player to fly to Steelton.
- In all other versions, the captain verifies that Bains will go after Colby if
  the card had been turned in.

- Attempting to interrupt the captain while he is talking to you about where
  Bains is going will result in him flapping his mouth without end and saying
  nothing in the process. This locks the game, except for menu access.
- This is easiest to attempt if you turn in the hit list, but try to show the
  captain the business card after he asks if Bains will go for Sonny or Colby
  next.
- In 1.001.000, the captain will restart the conversation (from the beginning)
  if he is interrupted.

- During Day 2, the player can have a conversation with the captain that
  overrides the usual dialogue (gives orders to go to the Warehouse).
- The only way for this to occur is for the player to visit Marie's house
  before they see the Captain. At that point, the player should access the
  phone (This does not work with the computer), then hang up. The captain
  will give his orders to go to the Warehouse, but Sonny is nowhere to be
  seen.
- In 1.001.000, Sonny will float across the screen during the conversation
  with the Captain (after using the phone).
- This situation cannot occur under normal circumstances, given how the game
  bugs out on the timer as soon as Sonny tries to drive to Marie's house
  after he arrives at the station. To fix this, enter debug mode immediately
  after the window background changes to driving through town (You only have
  half a second to enter the mode, give or take, so this has to be done
  FAST) and set the driver timers (158 & 159) to 0.

- Once in the stall, the usual routine of foul language becomes less of an
  issue.
  - use + (bathroom, lavatory, restroom crapper, shitter, stool, toilet,
    urinal, crapper)
  - leak, pee, piss, urinate, crap, defecate, dump, fart, poop, shit

  If you try any other combinations, you will get the usual 'bad language'
  response. There are additional actions you can take while in the stall:
  - pull down jeans
  - shake + (cock, dick, prick)
  - wipe (ass, butt, rear, tail)
  - flush + (crapper, shitter, stool, toilet, urinal)

  And yes, the flush verb is connected to a different set of nouns compared
  to the use verb.
- "The lock on your locker is is not the type you can pick."

- If you try to fire the gun while it is down and the target is riddled with
  holes, you are told to replace the target, rather than die.
- You can (safely) fire five times without hearing protection on. For a low-
  score run, this is more than enough room to ensure you can sight the gun.
  The sixth shot is game over.
- Enter in "View" while the target is halfway and the game will tell you that
  the target is 'as close as it will get'.
- Enter in "Press Back" while the the target is moving away you will be told

  outside the game window.

pic.013 -- Unmarked Car Interior

- Talking to Keith forces him to bring up his bad habit of smoking.
- If you type 'drive to murder' or 'drive to death' on the start of day 2, you
  are taken to the Warehouse. Otherwise, you get Keith saying there are no
  murders to follow up on.
- There are various places from PQ1 you can type in as places to go, but you
  cannot visit them. The game cites them as places that no longer exist. These
  include: Caffeine Castle, Hotel Delphoria, Blue Chamber and Drunk Willie.

- It is possible for the music instruments to get messed up if a background
  music (cove, airport) is still playing when it should not be after the score
  jingle is played.

** LEFTOVER BITS:
- 'drive 5556 fig ave.' will give the response "You have hotter leads to

  has the address "5556 OAK ST" on it, suggesting (at one point) it may have
  been an option to visit.

- It is possible to attempt to leave the parking lot and Keith will not return.
  Go up to the next scren, go back down and 'open door'. Keith would yell to
  wait up, but he ends up stuck behind a car (or something else; we cannot see
  him since it he out-of-bounds) and be unable to return to vehicle, locking
  the game, aside from menu access.

- The check for when Keith is off-screen to search for the stolen car is well
  within the bounds of the current screen. If the player tries to go off-screen
  on the left side while Keith is also on the far-left side of the screen, you
  will be told "You seem to have lost track of Keith, somehow", even though he
  is still on the screen.

- In J1.000.052, It is possible to softlock the during the motel sequence. If
  the player leaves after arriving at the motel (namely driving to Marie's), a
  situation is created where it becomes impossible to complete the game because
  Global 100 (that controls the current scenario) will never set to 13, even if
  the player does everything right to accomplish this. Without this set, Keith
  will not be ready to go to Steelton and he will not phone the captain for
  authorization to purchase the tickets.

- Using the Sonnymobile, the player can arrive at the airport, look at the
  stolen vehicle, open the door and 'dust mirror' and 'get print' (assuming
  the player brought a field kit along), return to the office, book the thumb
  print and return to the airport to collect it again.
- The game does not set the variable that controls that the stolen vehicle
  has been identified when using the personal car, so the player can leave the
  scene without getting a game over.

Moonwalking                            1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X
- The player will float around the screen and clip through any path blocker.
  The player can still exit along the top of screen where the walking pattern
  will change and Sonny will move around slowly on the screen.
- This can only be done with the Sonnymobile while it's pulling up to the
  Airport parking spot at the start of the game due to how the game
  (initially) handles Sonny's position on the screen. This will also
  (likely) require a decent amount of advance key pressing for the moonwalk
  to happen.
- If the player performs this without ever exiting the vehicle, the game
  will softlock, since Sonny will be unable to re-enter the vehicle,
  trapping the player there.

- You can walk outside the bounds of the screen with Keith following you
  (Easiest way is to the left just behind where you push the crossing button).
- In J1.000.052, Keith's behaviour was adjusted so he follows Sonny at a
  greater distance, preventing this from happening. Whether it's another
  'cultural' adjustment, like at Arnie's, a coincidence or they knew about the
  problem, it is resolved.

Keith's Roadside is Wrong              1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- Upon entering the screen from the bottom-right corner, Keith will appear on
  the other side of the road and walk across the road towards the player.
- Curiously, the taxi is never around when Keith wants to cross.

- Sonny can talk to the flower girl from any point on the screen once she
  has stopped.  He can also buy flowers from the flower girl.
- If Sonny buys a flower from her while a certain distance away (y-axis,
  mainly), she will turn to walk away, then stop and do nothing. She does not
  even leave the screen.
- In J1.000.052, You have to be close to purchase something.

Out of Bounds                          1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- On either side of the map is the ability to clip out of the room and stay
  out. The player's y-position can also be moved, despite getting the non-stop
  text popups that will allow the player to escape.
- Be careful if Keith is around the player, since he can trap Sonny outside the
  bounds.

  color. When it first opens, a bright purple briefly shows.

pic.016 -- Airport, Lobby

- This is one of the locations where Sonny can behave like a playboy.
- There is a whole list of places you 'could' buy a ticket to:
  - america, angeles, bangkok, boston, california, chicago, china, detroit,
    diego, england, france, francisco, hawaii, honolulu, italy, japan, korea,
    las, london, mars, mexico, mississippi, moon, moscow, nashville, nevada,
    nicaragua, north, paris, peking, philadelphia, philly, rome, russia, san,
    seattle, seoul, spain, tijuana, tokyo, valley, vegas, venus, virginia,
    washington, york, yosemite
  The only places you 'can' buy a ticket to are: Houston, Steelton, Beirut,
  Coarsegold and America. The only places you can complete a transaction to
  are: Houston and Steelton.
- If the player discovers Bains booked a flight to Houston, there is an option
  to try and pursue Bains by booking a flight to Houston as well.
- When buying a ticket to Steelton, the game will remove the field kit from
  inventory.

- Normally, when trying to buy a ticket, a player would stand at the front
  counter, enter the command, "buy ticket to steelton/houston", Keith runs
  around, makes a call and then the tickets can be purchased.
- This can also be done from the side. "buy ticket" and "steelton/houston" can
  be entered in separately. Even though the agent says "Would you please step
  around to the front of the counter, sir?", the check for beginning a ticket
  purchase is still enablded.
- If the player enters in "steelton/houston", Keith makes his move. One of two
  things can happen depending on the player position:
  - If the player is along the countertop, Keith will stand behind the player,
    then clip in front as he makes the call, the clips behind again when he is
    done.
  - If the player is even slightly away from the counter, Keith will try to
    walk to his spot, but Sonny blocks him and then eventually causes the game
    to lock up, minus access to the menu.

Keith the Wanderer                     1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- Normally, when trying to buy a ticket, a player would stand at the front
  counter, enter the command, "buy ticket to steelton/houston", Keith runs
  around, makes a call and then the tickets can be purchased.
- The easiest way to perform this is approach the female agent along the top
  side of the desk, "buy ticket" and "steelton/houston". If Keith is beside the
  player, Keith will start wandering all over the place, being unable to reach
  the desk on the other side. This locks the game, barring access to the menu.
  Some time after Keith leaves the room, this completely locks up the game.

Sonny is Secretly Keith                1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- If the player uses the phone at the airport and presses a directional key
  when leaving the phone screen (pic.444), the player will slide along the
  screen until the 'hang up' animation ends, then return to the original spot.
- If the player ues PgDown or right, Keith will appear instead of Sonny.

** ODD CODING:
Smuggling a Field Kit                  1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- The player is able to bring the field kit with them to Steelton if they buy
  the tickets first (The kit is removed from inventory when the Steelton
  tickets are purchased). However, the game assumes the player could not
  possibly have it, thus they will always be told it was checked on another
  flight and is now lost.

- Global 252 and 255 control asking the teller for the passenger list and when
  Keith arrives on the map. Since they both work as dual, unsigned byte, you
  can set them as follows once Keith arrives:
  - 252: $72c0 -> $52c0
  - 255: $6400 to $4400
- After Keith arrives, you can reset these two values, repeast 'ask list' and
  have another Keith spawn. This can give the player mobility problems once
  enough Keiths appear on the screen, but the game will crash once enough
  Keiths are on the screen (10 in 1.001.00 and 9 in 1.002.011, for instance).
- In 1.002.011, Having 6 or more Keiths on the screen will prevent the player
  from saving the game.
- J1.000.052, the global IDs may be a different number (a few numbers lower).

- There is a spot along the bottom-left side of the screen where the player can
  try to exit the room, but will be directed back in. While tricky to pull off,
  with Keith in the way, this will lock the player along the screen edge,
  perpetuating an endless dialogue box.

- Curiously, there are a number of things you can do at the station bathroom
  that cannot be done, here.
- There will be a guy in the bathroom on Day 2.
- "You look up and see the usual bathroom ceiling with flourescent lighting
  fixtures."

                                         X
- It is possible to try and get the gun twice. Complete the usual process for
  obtaining one: "Open door" "Open Toilet" "Look in" "Get gun" "Exit", but do
  not leave the room. Attempt to repeat the process and after you type in "Get
  gun" will result in an "Oops" and the game crashing.
- This bug only works while Sonny remains in the bathroom. Once Sonny leaves
  the bathroom, the toilet behaves as it should.
- The game describes you are already having the gun when you 'acquire gun',
  even if you have yet to obtain it.

Wandering Sonny                        1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X
- This can be performed during the closeup of the toilet.
- Using the arrow keys or mouse, sonny can move a unit at a time across the
  previous screen. Upon 'exit', the player will appear at a different point on
  the map based on what they hit/clicked.
- If Sonny ends up at x:272 and y:142 (roughly), the player will be re-
  directed to the airport lobby, but since the script is supposed to
  automatically move Sonny to a fixed location. This does not work outside the
  bathroom and will lock the game up, aside from menu access.
- This can be performed on both days.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.020 -- Airport, Security

- The player can draw their gun AFTER getting past the security checkpoint.
- In an unusual scene, showing Bains' mugshot ellicits a generic 'no one
  recognizes the mugshot' comment.
- If you walk up and down the gate enough times, the guard will start to
  comment on it.
- The security guard's reaction to the player's gun starts getting odd when
  the player is beyond the metal detector:
   - The guard only notices the gun drawn along the left half of the screen
     and (mostly) below the metal detector, though being close to the guard
     will also trigger his response.

** COMMANDS:
- look floor, ceiling
- look jerk (near Larry)
- get, cut, break rope
- arrest Larry
- show gun / kill guard (save first)
  - You can do this on the other side of the guard (show badge first, then walk
    past the metal detector). This can make for a more entertaining game over
    and can only be done near the guard.
- F8
  - The guard will only react if you do this along the bottom half of the
    screen, below the metal detector.

** BUGS:
Airplane Crashes Suck!                 1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X
- Purchase a pair of tickets to somewhere, get rid of Keith, then attempt to
  board the airplane. The game throws the player an "oops" since it (normally)
  calls for Keith to follow the player.
- By 1.000.006, the player is prevented from boarding the plane Keithless.

Bully Larry!                           1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- If Sonny is along the same x-axis as larry and he's too close for his arm
  shuffles, Larry will move one pixel away from sonny, effectively carting him
  across the screen. It is also possible that Larry will shift down a couple
  pixels, forcing the player to realign their position (try to line up Sonny's
  feet with Larry's).

I Have Houston Tickets! Is That OK?    1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X       X
- The player can buy tickets to Houston on day 1, keep them for day 2, proceed
  through day 2 like usual until it is time to leave for Steelton, then use the
  tickets in place of ones for Steelton.

                                         X       X
- The player can clip through the pathing blockers by drawing the gun as they
  go down the escalator. Doing this interrupts the process and will allow the
  player to move around the screen, even skipping past the security check.
  However, doing this also removes the exit to the room through the escalator,
  so unless the player has tickets, this will soft lock the game.

Really, He is That Good!               1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- No matter where the player is shot on the screen, Sonny will always appear
  along the bottom middle, in front of the metal detector.
- This was 'somewhat' fixed by J1.000.052. The security guy still faces forward
  while shooting Sonny, but now he drops dead where he was standing.

- The security check scene happens while the player is walking upwards. By
  walking diagonally, the player can walk right through the checkpoint without
  needing to show a badge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.022 -- Jail, outside

- The 'driving' timer is still counting down when Sonny arrives at the Jail
  when he is supposed to. So long as Sonny does not re-enter the vehicle when
  it hits 1, it is a non-issue.
- When pushing the buzzer, you can respond with (yes, y, affirmative) or (no,
  n).
- "Disgreeable, aren't you?"...

** COMMANDS:
- look friend
- look cruiser
- look jailer
- call, holler friend
- exit auto
- knock
- let me
- acquire in
- unlock door
- close door
- throw gun
- use extender

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.023 -- Jail, inside

- The 'driving' timer is set to 0 after Sonny leaves the jail. This only
  applies when the jail is the current objective.
- If the player brings the gun inside, the game removes the gun from inventory.
  When leaving the jail, the gun is returned and $5 is removed from the money
  clip (if there is $5).
- If the player brings the field kit inside, the kit is taken away from the
  player and returned upon leaving.

** COMMANDS:
- look down, up
- look wall
- ask, take, give, replace, get gun
- open cell, cage
- talk jailer
- talk dude
- open door

**BUGS:
Exact Change?  Nuh-uh!                 1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- The game will deduct $5.00 from Sonny's wallet IF the player brought Sonny's
  gun into the jail and has $6.00 or more to chip into the 'coffee fund'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.024 -- Airplane, dispenser (script.042)

- You can try to 'take' the bomb (for a game over, of course).

** COMMANDS:
- get towel
- use bracket
- disarm bomb
- look timer
- pull, bite  --  cable, wire
- eat bomb

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.025 -- Motel Parking Lot

- In version 1.001.000, this entire section is entirely optional.
- If the player tries to 'ask' for a warrant, they get the message they should
  call disptach.
- An alternate to showing the mugshot is to mention the name "Bill Cole" (Or
  just "Cole"), since the name is on the envelope corner you get off Woody.
  You will get the info, points and setup for the next step in the motel
  scenario.
- An alternate way of trying to enter the motel room is to 'kick the door'
  (like those old police shows), but since there is no way to evade the trap,
  this will always kill Sonny.
- Evading the trap door (while trying to open it) causes global variable 166
  (Gun Sighted) to be set back to 0. There is a casual mention of Sonny
  slamming his hand along the wall as this event happens. If the player skips
  the motel section, there is no need to reset the gun sights prior to the
  airplane trip.
- If the player returns to the motel after the incident has concluded, they
  will find the motel door boarded up, area taped off and an officer on standby
  to prevent Sonny from going inside, again. The player will be unable to open
  the door even if they have the motel key (Funny enough, the player is told
  they do not have the correct key). Kicking the door down is also disabled.
- script.225 replaces script.25 as the go-to for the motel after the scenario 
  has been completed (though different versions of the game arrive at this
  script differently). A number of important changes have been observed, 
  including:
  - 'look' gives a very crude and basic description of the location.
  - 'show badge' adds the wallet icon to the dialogue box.
  - 'mug shot' cannot be used, only 'mugshot' can.
  - Room numbers cannot be read.  
  - Manager cannot be looked at. Trying to arrest him gives a different 
    response.
  - Manager does not like you, so all his commentary is nasty, though you
    still operate with some police procedure.
  - 'exit room' talks about leaving a room you are not in.

** COMMANDS:
- look watch
- ask warrant
- arrest dude
- ask chamber
- return key
- give cash
- dude cole, bains
- get browning (face your trunk, does not work with Sonnymobile)
- talk friend
- open police
- police
- go pane
- look door (After it's blown open)
- kick door (not just Room 108)

** BUGS:

Backup Coming Through!                 1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X       X
- Sonny is scripted to automatically move down (out of the way) when backup
  arrives. If something is blocking Sonny from doing this (Being on the motel
  2nd floor without a clear path down the stairs, for instance), this will lock
  the game, aside from menu access. This happens because the game only checks
  for Sonny's y-position without taking the x-position into account, meaning
  Sonny will always move down when the player is too high, regardless of
  whether or not he is in the way of the backup cruiser.
- The player will clip through the stairs if Sonny should attempt to climb down
  to get out of the way. This likely has to do with ego's priority not being
  updated while moving down the screen. This was fixed along with the bug.

- The animation demonstrates that Chuck fires two shots at the motel room,
  though only one appears on screen to crash through the room window.

                                         X       X
- Sonny is still able to walk around the screen as backup rolls in, assuming
  Sonny is low enough to not trigger any special re-directs. The player can
  even position Sonny in front of the vehicle as it drives in.

Don't Wander Off, Sonny!               1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

  included.

  closed off due an issue with the game's design), the player can get back in
  the vehicle and drive to the inn again... and again... and again...

- The range for sonny being able to enter the unmarked vehicle is unually large
  (vertically); the event can be triggered as high up the screen as Sonny being
  right in front of the stairs leading to the 2nd floor of the motel.
- There are instances were, while it is rare, it is possible while facing and
  trying to enter the vehicle near the steps can result in the game locking up,
  except for access to the menu.

- Standing on the spot where warrant officer stops at will cause the AI to
  frantically circle around the player for a couple seconds, then suddenly stop
  and lock the game. Players can still access the menu, but will be unable to
  continue the current game.
- In Atari ST 1.001.006, the officer may not even attempt to move around the
  player and (simply) come to a stop while locking the game.

- After Sonny learns of Marie's kidnapping, the personal car check for which
  motel script is run is set to 225 (Post-crime scene). If the player drives to
  the motel using the personal car, they will be unable to access the motel
  room plus the the game movement and function keys will lock up. It is
  probable the script is waiting for Keith to get out of the vehicle and do/say
  something (which cannot happen under the circumstances).
- This is fixed by 1.001.006: There is no longer any unique update for the
  personal car.

  was shifted down a pixel.

- #1 Using down-left along the edge of the vehicle can get the player caught
  along the bottom of the vehicle. If the player speed has been set to a high
  enough value (slowest possible), there should be enough room to keep
  alternating between Down and PgDown to move right along the vehicle and
  escape. Otherwise, this may require a system reset.
- #2 Alternating between Right and PgDown along the bottom corner of the
  screen, the player can wrap around the map boundary and move around behind
  the lower half of the screen. It cuts off at 132, meaning the player cannot
  loop around the entire screen and come back out on other side unless they
  are willing to move and see the popup text in excess of 21,000+ times.
- On an amusing note: If the player has moved far enough away from the screen,
  Keith will start following the player through the clipped wall. If the player
  manages to return to the vehicle and Keith is stuck and unable to return,
  this will lock up the game, though the menu will be accessible.

- If Sonny drives away in his personal vehicle to somewhere and comes back,
  the crime scene is left intact.  This happens because the personal vehicle
  check for which motel script is run is not updated by the motel or crime
  scene related stuff.
- This no longer applies after Sonny learns of Marie's kidnapping, since the
  motel script is updated to 225 for the personal vehicle 'after' the
  kidnapping has been determined.
- As of 1.001.006. The crime scene will be cleaned up after Sonny drives
  somewhere.

- If Sonny enters the unmarked vehicle any time after Global Variable 100 is
  set to 12 (After the door to room 108 is blown open by Bains' trap) and
  exit, the crime scene will be cleaned up and Sonny will be unable to enter
  the motel room.
- This does not happen if Sonny is using his personal car for the scenario.
  If the player returns to the scene before visiting Marie using the personal
  car, they can still access the motel room.
- As of 1.001.006. Exiting and re-entering will clear up the tear gas (if it is
  active) and the crime scene remains intact.

  his arrival spot).

- Attempting to get the Browning shotgun out of the trunk before Keith grebs it
  will tell the player Sonny should not remove it from the trunk, even though
  it's not there.
- If Keith has been in the motel and the Field Kit is not in the trunk, the
  game will tell Sonny the trunk is empty, even though the same dialogue for
  trying to remove the Browning will appear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.026 -- Motel, inside

- The control layer has the infamous "THIS IS MICKIE'S ROOM" carved in. In
  theory, it could 'sort of' be navigated if the player's X and Y values are
  modified so the player can walk around those letters.
- The envelope's contents can only be read while in the room.

** COMMANDS:
- get browning (more interesting if Keith is not with you)
- get television (top side bed)
- lie, nap, sat
- turn card (after getting it)
- wash hands
- flush toilet
- acquire crap

- This can only happen under a set of circumstances:
  - Player must be using the Sonnymobile, not the unmarked car.
  - Player must not visit Marie's place.
  The player can enter the room and obtain the envelope and a blood sample (if
  the player brought a field kit along), go back to the office, both them both
  as evidence (for points), then drive back to the inn and collect the items
  again.
- The Colby business card and lipstick can only be picked up once.
- By 1.000.006, they fixed the unmarked vs Sonnymobile issues when it came to
  handling the motel scenario scripts.
- Reading the contents of the envelope does not affect this bug.

** ODD CODING:
- The guide creator knows this has to do with local variables, but is amusing
  that the drawer automatically closes when the player leaves Room 108.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.027 -- Warehouse

- The event is not set until after the player talks to the captain on Day 2. If
  the player drives there immediately after day 2 starts, they will find
  nothing (This requires a debug edit immediately after driving to the
  warehouse, or else the player will have a chat with the captain).
- You can get the blood and camera shots before moving in for a close-up of the
  trunk.
- "After carefull consideration" has two l's. This is in all versions of the
  game.

** COMMANDS:
- drink blood (eww...)
- frisk, look in car (lol)
- get hair, dirt
- make cast
- look broad

- The player can re-enter the vehicle before the exit sequence is completed.
  Normally, this would not happen because Keith demands the player wait for
  him.
- The only exception to this is when they immediately arrive at the scene.

- The Coroner and vehicle sprites can be permanently left at the scene if the
  player leaves the area (drives somewhere else) before moving the body from
  the trunk to the coroner's vehicle.  The crime scene will be cleaned up
  upon their arrival, but the vehicle and guy remain (even though dialogue
  does not indicate they are there).
- If the player enters in 'move body', the script will attempt to perform the
  animations to move the body, but the game will throw the player an "oops"
  and abruptly end.

- If the player is pinned along the bottom right corner of the vehicle and the
  game tries to re-direct Sonny across the screen to move out of the way, Sonny
  will be unble to walk across the screen, which interrupts and locks the game,
  except for the menu.
- If the player happens to be around the bottom left corner of the vehicle, it
  is possible for the script to complete without Sonny blocking the path.
- As of 1.000.006, a pathblocker is placed along the right side of the screen,
  preventing the player from getting to the coroner bottom-right corner.
  However, this clears up once the player gets the out-of-bounds message after
  trying to wander off the screen.
- In later versions this was 'fixed' by giving a "you're not close enough"
  reponse when it was time to move the body.

- If the driving timer dips below 90 seconds and the player (eventually)
  arrives at the Warehouse, the crime scene will be clear and Keith will
  comment on how they should have gotten there sooner. The driver timer is set
  to 1 and the player is in trouble as soon as they get in the car. However,
  another trip back to the Warehouse will show the crime scene is fully intact,
  again.

- If the timer hits 1 after Dispatch's final message is displayed (this is just
  before the screen changes over to the Warehouse), the event will not trigger.
  Instead, Keith simply gets out of the car, walks into the fence and asks
  (with a textbox that is 1/3 out of the screen) if they are meeting someone.
- While this is a normal bug, trying to time this under regular circumstances
  would be next to impossible. It would be a lot easier to use debug mode and
  set 158 to 1 as you get the dispatch message confirming your arrival (Too
  early and you will get the call from Captain Hall).

- Rapidly pressing keys while the cutscene plays and having the game speed set
  to '3' seems to hamper the script that controls Mario to the point he will be
  in Keith's way as he tries to walk around the vehicle and (instead) walks
  with Mario to his car.

- Not bringing Keith along causes a crash. Immediately after Sonny gets out of
  the car, officer Gelepsi begins his recounting of what happened. Partway
  through, the game throws the player an "oops" and the game abruptly ends.
- This cannot be performed under normal circumstances. This requires the player
  to enter debug mode (after entering the Sonnymobile) and reset the driver
  timer variables (158 and 159 to 0) before driving to the Warehouse in the
  Sonnymobile.
- There is a way to get around the crash. Upon arriving at the scene, type in
  'open door' as you pull in, wait for Sonny to get out, then keep hitting F3
  in the hopes that you manage to open the door and escape the sequence that
  normally kills the game. If this is done right, the player can still carry on
  with this part of the game. However, after examining the body, the
  Sonnymobile will be replaced with the unmarked car and Keith will be there
  (because Global131 is changed from 33 to 13).

- It is possible to clip through the left-side of the screen by holding down
  the left button while trying to get through the message prior to turning
  around. If the player can time it right, Sonny will continue walking left,
  clipping past the barrier and have the player's X position (eventually) loop
  around and have Sonny appear on the right side of the screen. At maximum
  speed, it takes a little over a minute for him to walk around.

- This can only be done with the Sonnymobile and requires mouse support.
- Instead of pushing a direction, the player needs to click on screen
  immediately after the parking lot loads. Sonny starts along the top-left
  corner of the screen (Y-position is 0, meaning you only see his shoe)
  before exiting the car. If timed right, Sonny will moonwalk to where the
  mouse was clicked horizontally. Upon reaching that spot, the player's Y-

- If the player brings Keith along to the dinner date with Marie, Keith will
  prefer to nap in the vehicle rather than go inside to eat (Just don't tell
  the captain).
- This can be performed in one of two (known) ways:
  * Use debug to patch in inventory #3 (unmarked car keys) and take the
    unmarked car to Arnie's
  * Use debug to set global variable 131 to 13 while en route to the restaurant
    via the normal way. When Sonny arrives, it will show the unmarked car,
    instead.

pic.030 -- Arnie's Inside

- Many of the innapropriate words "eat, fuck, hump, screw, blow, suck" can be
  used on Marie.
- You can try to 'fuck patron', but it goes about as well as expected.
- Kissing patron/customer is not allowed, it seems. Instead, you get a
  generic response.
- Player can leave a $5 tip (per tip).
- Do NOT enter the smoking section.
- 1/2 price menu is available IF the player shows Sonny's badge to the waiter.
  This changes three values in memory to reflect the prices. To do this:
  'ask price', 'show badge'.
- The game comments on Sonny abandoning Marie at the restaurant, if he does.
- If you want, you can stand up after taking the orders and leave the
  restaurant.
- The restaurant has (what appears to be) 2 timers for events. The timer seems
  to work at around 10 frames per second at normal speed.
  - Arrive: 1500, Timer 1
    - If you do not find Marie and sit down by this point, you get the "Not in
      the mood" message and the event ends.
    - If this hits zero and Sonny has sat down with Marie, he will comment on
      how such a romantic evening has got his appetite going. This resets
      the counter to 1500 and continues to repeat until Sonny has eaten.
    - If this hits zero and Sonny has eaten, but has not kissed Marie, he will
      comment on wanting 'romantic time' with Marie.
    - If this hits zero, and Sonny has kissed Marie, the event ends. Eating
      does not affect the outcome.
  - Sit down with Marie: 100, Timer 2
    - The waiter arrives and takes your order.
    - There does not seem to be any additional timer that can mess up this
      process.
  - Order Taken: 300, Timer 3, 450, Timer 4. Once Timer 3 runs out, Timer 4
    starts.
  - Timers 3 and 4 reach zero: Order is delivered.
- The waiter is coded to ignore all other objects, path blockers, etc.

- In 1.024 and 1.002.011:
  - Use phone does not give you the generic 'Crimebusters' response.

  - The waiter does not appear when Sonny enters, leaving Sonny to seat
    himself. Whether this is due to a 'cultural' adjustment, they had trouble
    including the script or omitted this for some other reason is
    unknown.
  - Marie's unique theme does not play when the player approaches her.
  - The score jingle does not play while the restaurant theme plays (If the
    2nd music setting is set through install.exe).

** COMMANDS:
- use phone
- get money, cash
- open register
- beg
- goodbye (funnier if Sonny tries to walk out on Marie)

- After the waiter gets Sonny's order and stands up, he can walk behind the
  wall and ignore the smoking section warning (which normally stops the
  player).
- In 1.001.000, there is a red smoke effect (upper left corner) that has a
  tendency to linger around.
- In 1.002.011, the main smoke effect has an unusual overlap over the wall that
  makes a small part of the wall blink with a light cyan colour.

  Sonny stands, he will moonwalk as long as the pathing allows.

- Right-clicking on the screen while Sonny is sitting down will cause another
  Sonny to appear on the screen. This one can even leave the restaurant, if
  the players wants him to.
- In J1.000.052, it is possible to walk Sonny right into the restaurant using
  a mix of the mouse and keyboard inputs.

- If the player tries to get up and leave after the meals have been delivered,
  but before they are consumed, the game will comment on the player's turkey
  habits, then the waiter will hand off the bill. The restaurant ending plays
  as normal. However, if this is performed 'after' the meal has been eaten, the
  game will treat this as the player abandoning Marie which allows Sonny to
  avoid paying for the (free) meal.

- The player will walk and respond to anything that blocks Sonny's path.
- This can only be done with the Sonnymobile at the start of the game while it
  is pulling up in front of the house and will (likely) require a decent amount
  of advance key pressing for the moonwalk to happen.
- This (appears to) require a fresh, new game (or Day 2 with some global
  variable mods) to perform.

- Should the player take the unmarked car to Marie's place on day 1, Keith will
  wait in the car. If the trunk was left open when leaving Marie's place, the
  trunk will appear closed as Keith yells at Sonny to get a move on, then it
  pops open for him.

pic.032 -- Marie's House, Inside

- Player can search the chair and sofa and find $3, adding it to your money
  clip. This can be done at any point in the game, prior to departing for
  Steelton.
- On Day 2, the game allows the player to search Marie's house on their own
  without having Keith around (Player can drive their own vehicle to Marie's).
  The game was setup to handle this.

** COMMANDS:                    (Different on Day 2?)

- If the player tries to exit the house immediately after entering it, a glitch
  happens where the player's regular movements are disabled due to an issue
  with Keith not completing his script to walk down the hall and into the
  bedroom. The player still has acesss to the parser and function keys. To
  break out of this, Sonny can draw his gun. This creates a moonwalking effect
  where the player will resume movement but will always be facing upwards.
- The player can withdraw Sonny's gun and the moonwalking effect will continue.
- Alternatively, this bug can become active by trying to draw the gun and walk 
  around as Keith returns to the front door (because the player is trying to 
  leave the house).

- The ashtray can be dusted and prints collected. These prints use the same
  inventory ID as the prints collected from the jailer's car. There is nothing
  in the game that tracks which prints have been collected. Since evidence
  counts for one point each when booked, this becomes a spot for infinite
  points.
- This can be collected at any point during regular game play, even on Day 1,
  before the kidnapping happens.

  Sonny's position, leaving the tv antenna and shadow to appear in front of the
  Sonny when positioned around there.

pic.033 -- Sonny's vehicle.

- Driving anywhere while the timer is counting down will cause the timer to run
  down at a rate of frames, rather than seconds.
- Do not enter this vehicle while under orders to investgate Cotton Cove and
  the Warehouse (Global 100 = 5 or 10). Doing these will set the driver timer
  to 3. If you are on your first timer, it will also set the second timer to
  600. When that happens, no matter where you go, you will get in trouble back
  at the station.
- If the player tries to drive anywhere after arriving at the station on day 2
  (Global 100 = 8), but before getting their orders to go to the warehouse, the
  timer will be set to 10 seconds and the player will get pulled over, quickly.
  This happens regardless of what the current timer is at.
- Driving to Marie's place early in the JP version has Keith commenting on if
  Sonny would rather be alone, which the usual day 1 response.

** COMMANDS:
- draw gun
- drive car
- drive murder

  motel, they can 'look window' and get a comment about how they are still at

- Click the mouse on the screen while Sonny is driving somewhere will have
  Sonny walk in front of Sonny.
- This can also work while Sonny's vehicle is stationary, but the detail
  outside the window is treated as a sort of path blocker, so the player will
  have to loop Sonny around the detail before he can appear.

- There is a nasty softlock that can take place IF the player waits around 10-
  11 minutes, THEN drives somewhere (without opening the door to the car at
  least once). If the player waits long enough, Sonny will get pulled over,
  taken back to the station, given the usual lecture, then gets his orders to
  go to jail. However, during this, the game will not take the keys from the
  ignition and the personal car door remains locked. This will prevent Sonny
  from entering the office, going back to his car, getting his badge, etc., all
  critical to completing the game.

pic.040 -- Airplane, cabin

- If you board with a ticket to Houston, you can go through the usual start,
  then you are escorted off the plane, since there is no need to go there. For
  lulz, you can also say 'no' when asked if you are Detective Bonds during the
  process or wait it out while the stewardess endlessly asks you the same
  question (She secretly thinks you are).
- This is one of the locations where Sonny can behave like a playboy.
- The player is given:
  - 140 seconds to disarm the bomb in 1.001.000.
  - 120 seconds to disarm the bomb in all other versions.
- The game over used when you shoot the hijacker in 1.001.000 is a poorly
  worded run-on sentence. It was fixed by 1.001.006.
- "You down the alchohol quickly, and it seems to make you feel better..."

** COMMANDS:

- There is a small window during the hijacking after the stewardess falls on
  the floor where if Sonny draws his gun and fires right before the hijacker
  attacks Sonny, the bullet hit will register too late and the hijacker's kill
  animation begins, killing the player, instead. Given there is no unique
  circumstance for this, the player is told they missed because the gun was not
  sighted, even if it is.
- By version 1.001.006, Sonny's bullet registers a kill much faster and the
  game prevents the player from firing once the hijacker performs his kill
  animation.

pic.060 -- Cotton Cove (Middle)

- Sonny appears a few more pixels to the right when entering from the right
  in 1.002.011.
- There are lesser-known dialogues on this screen:
  - If Sonny fires before Bains appears on the screen, the game will say Sonny
    ID'ed and pre-emptively fired at him, causing him to flee. This is easier
    to execute if the player sets their speed to a higher value (slow) and
    listens very carefully for when the music starts.
  - If the player heads for the crime scene first (instead of pursuing/radioing
    in after the ambush), and does one of 4 actions at the spot with blood so
    Keith shows up and leaves to radio in a diver, Sonny can follow Keith and a
    unique "Boy, Keith moves FAST" dialogue will appear.  Even if this is done
    first, the player can still return to the unmarked car and radio in the
    situation for points. This also means the player can start the scene with
    the field kit and make a single trip over to the crime scene to collect
    evidence.
  - After Bains flees the scene, player can enter in 'halt' for Sonny to order
    Bains to stop. This ends once the sedan arrives.
- "You have an unneasy feeling, as though"...

** COMMANDS:
- look behind tree
- look lake
- look under bush
- look clue, evidence, blood, mark, footprint, feet print
- look heart
- halt, freeze, police (bains)
- look bains (after shooting)
- apprehend, pursue, chase bains

- If the player is firing the gun while the van with Officer Moore inside
  arrives, different events can happen:
  - In version 1.001.000, Sonny will put away his gun as the van arrives and
    the game freezes with no way to access the menu, exit the game, etc.
  - In version 1.000.006, Sonny will briefly put away his gun while Moore
    arrives, but the gun will be back out again once he comes out of the van.
  - In version 1.024, 1.002.011 and J1.000.052, Sonny will have an unusual pose
    while facing the approaching van and the game will lock up. The rest of the
    scene with Moore exiting the vehicle will play out, but the only thing the
    player can do is access the menu.

- After the ambush, Keith will follow the player fairly close and stay along
  the same y-axis. Enter the screen from the right as low as possible and use
  diagonal keys to get in front of Keith when the player is turned around.
  This should lock the game and (possibly) prevent menu access.

                                         X
- Prior to the Bains ambush, the 'ominous' music will play on this screen.
  This can be observed before Bains' escape, the Jail scenario and the Mall
  scenario.

- If the player is hit at the left edge of the screen by the Bainsmobile, the
  vehicle will drive off, back up into the middle(ish) of the screen, then
  drive off again. Keith will get off his comment about who is driving the
  vehicle, then the game freezes.
- This is partially fixed by version 1.002.011 / 1.024. The glitch can still
  happen, though it is unlikely the player will see the vehicle backing up.
- This cannot happen in the JP version since and the car scene is unused on
  this screen.

- During the shootout, if Sonny escapes Bains' ambush, rather than engaging and
  happens to walk off the screen right as Bains fires his third shot, the next
  screen over glitches Sonny's movement animation by replacing it with a dying
  cycle that loops over. This animation prevents the player from moving up and
  down, but it can be cancelled by performing some other action, like drawing
  Sonny's gun.

- During the shootout, if Sonny escapes Bains' ambush, his walking animation
  frame rate slows to half speed. This does affect his movement speed, but
  rather how slow he 'appears' to move.

- During the shootout, if Sonny's fires during Bains' final shot, Bains will
  manage to escape, but Sonny will 'start' to fall to the ground from a fatal
  wound and will stay in mid-air right up to the 'game over' screen.
- In versions 1.001.000, the death animation will be interrupted and will leave
   the player hanging in the air, but still alive.

- Following the shootout and prior to finding the crime scene, Keith will walk
  behind Sonny. Typing in "look Keith" while on the far left side of the screen
  will result in the game saying "Keith is not here." while he 'is' there.
- 1.002.011 ends up going the other way around, inserting a random comment
  about Keith even though he is not on screen.

(The 'Follow Moore' bugs requires the player to let Moore walk to the middle of
the screen after getting out of the van and ask why he is there. From there,
Sonny can ask Moore to go diving while he is much closer to the van, so long
as he remains close enough to Moore. For J1.052, 1.024 and 2.011, the game
prevents Sonny from moving while Moore is on the move.)

- If Sonny manages to place himself on the position Moore is scripted to go to
  after getting changed, Moore will be unable to complete his action, which
  results in the game locking up, except for access to menu.
- This is similar to the warrant officer bug in pic.025 (Motel Parking Lot).

- If Sonny is stuck along the path Moore takes to walk to his position on the
  map after getting changed, Moore may follow an erratic and random pattern
  around the screen until he is teleported to where he is supposed to go.
- In all versions after that, he simply walks around Sonny.
- This is similar to the warrant officer bug in pic.025 (Motel Parking Lot).

- If Sonny stands in front of the door after asking Moore to go diving, Moore
  will clip through Sonny, open the door, Moore disappears, then the door opens
  again and Sonny is taken into the van.
- The player can complete the diving sequence without finding the certificate
  by using this exploit.

- Getting hit by the Bainsmobile without Keith locks the game.
- This cannot happen in the J1.000.052 version since the car scene is unused on
  this screen.
- This cannot be performed under normal circumstances, given that entering the
  Sonnymobile while under orders to investigate the cove changes the driver
  timer so you end up with 3 seconds left. To fix this, enter debug mode and
  set the driver timers to 0 AFTER you climb in the Sonnymobile so you can
  travel to Cotton Cove without any problems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.061 -- Cotton Cove (Right)

- This is one of the locations where Sonny can behave like a playboy.
- The driving timer is set to 0 as soon as you pull in (current objective).
- While the dialogue for it has always been in the game since 1.001.000, the
  scripting in script.061 was edited in 1.001.006 to include the option to ask
  officer Gelepsi to call a Coroner on your behalf. While it sets the same flag
  as radioing the call, yourself, it awards the player the wrong amount of
  points and can lead to a score that exceeds the game's normal 300 limit.
  This 'issue' does not appear 1.001.000, but was introduced in 1.001.006 and is
  carried into 1.002.011 and J1.000.052.
- After the shootout, you can enter the car and either radio in the incident
  or you can pursue/chase bains. Both award the same points. If you ignore
  the captain's calls to return to Cotton Cove to investigate, you will be
  taken to the Airport (where there is no black car, yet). Keep in mind, a
  timer will still be counting down that will compel the player to return to
  the cove before doing anything else.
- If you try to exit the screen to the right and have spoken to the jogger,
  the game will tell you 'upriver, not downriver', meaning you are still
  going the wrong way.
- Officer Gelepsi has unique dialogue should Sonny arrive at Cotton Cove in
  his personal vehicle. Under normal circumstances, this is not possible due
  to how the driving timers are handled while the game scenario is set to 5.

                                         X       X
- Prior to finding the crime scene, if the player walks from the middle screen
  to the right screen as close to the bottom as possible, Keith will instantly
  move from behind Sonny to a much higher position on the screen, enough so the
  player can see his feet.

Keith Cocklocks You                    1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                                         X
- Since Keith follows the player (before finding the crime scene) and is the
  same vertical placement, if Sonny enter the screen as close to the bottom as
  possible, Keith will also be along the same height. If Sonny moves down along
  the bottom of the screen, the game will try to automove Sonny back to Cotton
  Cove. Using diagonal movement around Keith will cause the player to end up in
  front and lock up the game.

Moonwalking                            1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011
                                         X
- The player only briefly moonwalks away from the car. Once the driving
  sequence is complete, Sonny is placed back in his starting position just
  above the car.
- For some reason, the developers decided to move Sonny away from the vehicle
  prior to the player gaining control over him.
- This can only happen at the very beginning of Day 1 due to how the game
  treats Sonny's initial position on the map.

- The player can walk over to the left screen (060), retreat before Bains
  arrives, walk back to the jogger and 'ask blood' to score additional points.

What Diver?                            1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- If Keith radios in a diving team and the player gets in the vehicle to
  drive somewhere before they show, then drive back to the cove (immediately),
  they will find the crime scene has been cleaned up but there is still time
  left for the diver to show up.  When that timer hits zero, the vehicle shows
  up on screen. However, after leaving the screen, they will find no vehicle
  has arrived, even after they return to the first screen.

- If the player enters in 'show blood' instead of anything else related to the
  incident, the jogger will point Sonny in the right direction (but refuses to
  go along). The game treats this the game as asking about the blood, and will
  not reward the player any points afterwards, no matter how many times the
  player enters in 'ask blood'.

Where is the Blood?                    1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- There is a different set of rules and conditions when asking about blood
  compared to showing the blood. The 'too far' comments are quite different and
  the distance required for 'show blood' is a fair bit smaller than simply
  asking about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.062 -- Cotton Cove (Left)

- You can follow Bains as he flees from Sonny.
- This is one of two screens where Sonny can get run over by the Bainsmobile.
- If the player is hit by the vehicle, the player will get a "Thank you for
  playing Police Quest 2" then a proper game over. On this screen, Jim says
  something slightly different, "Don't worry, though; Keith will explain in his
  report how he herocially 'watched your back'." . The obvious change is the
  inclusion of 'though'.
- There is a unique game over on this screen if the player is hit by the
  Bainsmobile and Keith is not present. This cannot happen under normal
  circumstances due to driving timers preventing the player from seeing it.
- The camera can used at any point/direction on the screen and does not
  contribute to Keith entering the scene and calling in a diving team.

** COMMANDS:
- look behind tree
- look under bush
- look clock
- smell
- get clue
- dust can
- frisk panties
- look plate (bains)
- call coroner (to Moore)
- throw body back (requires body)

                                         X
- The player must stand as far away from the crime scene as possible and
  perform:
  - look blood
  - get blood
  - make cast

  After this, Keith will show up. Is Sonny is far away, Keith with be
  unable to reach the spot he is supposed to walk to, which locks the game,
  except for menu access.
- By 1.001.006, Keith stops a few pixels further away, preventing the path
  blocking from happening.

- For this to work, the player must abort the diving sequence (surface, rise,
  lid), head to the middle screen to change, then exit the screen as Moore
  enters (before he can speak). Re-enter the screen and head to the far left.
  Moore will escort Sonny to the 'body'.
- The player is unable to interact with a body, since there is none there.
- So long as global variable 100 is set to 6, this scene can be re-enacted as
  many times as the player wants.

 - Sonny must be at the very edge of the screen and time moving right right
   as Bains hits him with his (stolen) vehicle. If done right, the first
   animation of being hit by the vehicle will play, but the screen will
   transition to the center on with Sonny carrying on as though nothing
   happened.

pic.063 -- Cotton Cove, Underwater middle

- If you get the first warning you are running out of air, you can still make
  it to the surface before you get a game over, though you must react fast.
- The air's rate of depletion is 2 units every frame. Sonny needs 45 frames to
  complete the dive (+1 to allow the parser to do stuff), leaving 2108 units of
  air left to explore. At a default speed of 6, that's 20 units per second
  being consumed, leaving a maximum time of 1 minute, 45.4 seconds, not counting
  the slower rate on the right screen.

- The player can navigate beyond the boundaries of the map by alternating
  between down and left along the bottom corner of the screen. Given the
  constant +2 being added to the player's x-value per frame, it is probably
  the player will be unable to return to the inside of the map.

- You can look up the VIN number on the stolen car, but not on Pate's vehicle...
- "Look / Read license" will give one of a list of slightly different
  responses.
- The driving counter is set to 0 as soon as you pull in (current objective).
- You can ask the lady a number of different things, such as her name, number,
  address, etc., but all she will tell you about is her car (Sounds like she
  might have issues).
- After your business is concluded and you wait long enough in the car, if you
  exit, the cop, lady and 2 vehicles will be gone.

- Along the right side of the map the parking lot is setup at an angle that
  goes toward the lower right side of the screen. Alternating between down and
  down-right will eventually result in the player getting stuck in the corner.
  If the game speed is slow enough, it is possible to break out this corner.
  Otherwise, this will require a lucky CTRL-Q, a lucky ESCAPE to menu or a
  system reboot to get out.

  - Bains will clip through the player to enter the room, then fire at Sonny,
    regardless of which direction he would have to face to shoot him.
  - Starting with the Amiga version, Bains will fire as soon as the sprite
    appears on the screen.

HALT!                                  1.000   1.006   J1.052  1.024   2.011

- Ordering Bains to "HALT" will cause him to stop and shoot wherever he stands,
  forcing the player to shoot at him immediately to prevent him from killing
  Sonny. The player can start firing back and kill Bains. The cutscene will
  start to play, but without Bains in the proper spot for Sonny to walk over
  to the body, the game locks up.
- If the player waits until Bains start shooting to tell him to "HALT"
  (assuming Sonny has taken a proper hiding position), this will not affect
  the cutscene.
- Yelling at Bains to halt resets the counter on the number of shots fired at
  Sonny before he kills him. This can be used to interrupt Bains' easy kill
  should the player be out of position and not ready to attack. However, this
  will still lock the game if he is too far from where he is supposed to stop.
  Bains will not change direction and will continue to fire at the pipe Sonny
  (normally) hides behind during the shootout. This still counts towards the
  number of shots needed to kill Sonny, regardless of where in the room he is
  standing (even behind Bains).
- Sonny can leave the room while using the "HALT" glitch, but since the script
  outside the room is not updated with Bains being inside the room, a second
  Bains will show up and gun Sonny down.

  - Placing Sonny in front of Bains will prevent him from entering the room.
    This remains in place until the player either moves out of the way or
    fires his gun, which allows Bains to clip through the player and keep
    walking.
  - Typing in 'halt' will cause Bains to start firing at the player.

- Sonny can clip through the far-left side of the pipe if the x-position is
  perfectly aligned to do so. The best way is to watch the 2nd left-most brick
  along the 2nd layer be 1 light grey pixel away from Sonny's left shoulder.
  That will allow the player to 'just' clip through the pipe, but go all the
  way around.

pic.078 -- Burt Park, Entrance

- This is one of the very few screens in the game where absolutely nothing the
  player can go will cause a game over, nor will any special events trigger
  that can cause it.
- If the player manages to escape the mugger and retreat to this screen, they
  will get a message telling them the mugger has given up the chase. The
  easiest eay to accomplish this is to walk around the lower right corner of
  the park screen above. When the player gets the message about an approaching
  person, try to get as close to the bottom of the screen as possible. After
  showing the badge, the mugger will flee, but the player should be able to
  exit the screen faster.  Should the player exit the screen before the
  scene is complete, they can face the mugger again.

  - Pitman will float toward the bottom of the screen, instead of walk.

** ODD CODING:
  - Normally, along the bottom of the map, when the player goes down too far,
    they get a message and are redirected back onto the screen. However,
    along the far left and mid-right are bush edges. If the player hugs them,
    they can skip past the redirect and go a fair ways below the screen (The
    player's Y-value caps at 237, which puts the entire sprite of Sonny just
    under the screen).
    This is updated in 1.001.006, 1.002.011 and J1.000.052 by adding something
    that 'bounces' the player in the other direction when they get too close to
    the bushes.

pic.079 -- Burt Park, pond, west side

- While the range is tiny, it is possible for the player to encounter the punk
  on this map. He approaches / retreats from the south, making use of some
  sprites originally found to be unused.
- Due to the positioning of where the mugger and player are when the encounter
  begins, it's not impossible for the player to retreat to either the screen to
  the left (the mugger pursues) or down (the mugger refuses to follow).
- Shooting your gun with the punk on the scene is an immediate game over.
- The dog appears once the player has dealt with the mugger.

- If the player is on one side of the lower bush and the thug is on the other

  flees, but becomes path blocked, which prevents the rest of the script from
  being executed. This will lock the game, aside from accessing the menu.

- The player needs to move far enough away, then back towards the manhole to
  trigger the punk, 'use radio', then climb down the manhole. So long as the
  player does not waste anytime between the radio call and going into the
  sewer, they can keep repeating this as many times as they like to earn as
  many extra points as they want to.
  - Alternatively, the player can also wait for Keith to arrive,
    'read rights', 'talk mugger', THEN climb down for 9 free points. So long
    as this has been completed before Keith tries to take the mugger away,
    this can be repeated without limit.
- The view IDs for Sonny is incorrect during this sequence and the misc.
  images for Burt Park are used in his place as he goes into the sewer. This
  happens because the game is trying to move Sonny to a pre-determined
  position on map for Keith to bring the punk back over, but the view ID
  is not updated, so it is using the right directional sprites, but the wrong
  ID.
- If the player shows badge, gun or calls out police, the mugger will escape
  and not return.
- If the mugger is physically preventing Sonny from climbing down the sewer
  (because the player did not do something to make the mugger escape), this
  will lock the game, except for menu access.

- Continually collecting the fingerprints without opening the glove box will
  allow the player to earn as many extra points as they want to.
- The path blocker and commands for Luis Pate's vehicle are always on the map,
  regardless of whether or not the vehicle is there. The player can go along
  the bottom of the screen (right side, in the parking spot) and type 'open
  door' to gain access to the vehicle. With a Field Kit on-hand, the player can
  'dust box' and 'use tape' to get a fingerprint. After that, drive to the
  station and book the evidence.
- The game does not track fingerprint evidence nor does it update the map data
  to remove access to the vehicle (which it is supposed to). This means the
  player can keep returning to the mall and perform this as many times as they
  want to (Until Sonny leaves for Steelton).
- If the glove box is opened, the player loses the ability to obtain the
  prints.

- Using the arrow keys or mouse, sonny can move a unit at a time across the
  previous screen while looking at the toilet tank. Upon 'exit', the player
  will appear at a different point on the map based on what they hit/clicked.
- Because the game automatically re-locates Sonny to the open door of Pate's
  car, this can only be confimed thgouh:
  - A memory editor while looking up and x and y values of the player.
  - 'kiss angel of death' and ALT-E to vieo ego's position.

- After rattling the manhole cover and climbing back down, should the player
  climb up the manhole, Bains will still show up, kill the player and leave.
  Sonny's dead body is left badly positioned and clipping into the wall.
- By 1.001.006, Bains no longer shows up while Sonny is up the ladder.

(And other fun stuff!)                   X
- A (partial) out-of-bounds glitch can happen under a set of circumstances:
  - The player climbs the ladder, attempts to move the cover, then climbs back
    down.

    -- AND --

    The player draws out the gun and fires it as Bains enters the room. If the
    player is firing as Bains enters the room to fire at Sonny, the animation
    set will be stuck at the player drawing their weapon as they move around
    the room while ignoring pathing walls/blockers. The player can still exit
    the room, but they will be no longer able to fire their weapon (So whatever
    you do, do not attempt to finish the game or save your progress after
    completing this glitch).
    To fix the glitch, the player must withdraw their gun before leaving the
    room.

    -- OR --

    The player is drawing their gun while Bains enters the room. This causes a
    similar glitch problem like what happens above and Sonny will be unable to
    raise his weapon and kill Bains, effectively softlocking the the game.

    -- OR --

    The player falls into the water. If timed right and Bains approaches and
    fires before Sonny completely falls in, he will animate and splash around
    the entire room. However, this prevents all map exits from running
    properly, leaving the player trapped.

- By 1.001.006, Bains no longer shows up while Sonny fires his gun or falls
  into the sewer muck.

  Sonny will hop back down to the ground with gun in-hand.

- On the upper-left side of the sewer is a methane pocket that spans two
  screens. Moving from the middle left screen to the upper left screen will
  cause the mask to disappear.  If the gun has been drawn, the mask is still
  'technically' on, but the wrong sprite will be used.
- 'remove mask' results in the mask being removed, but the gun is out, instead.
- On a side note: This glitch will allow a player to shoot a methane gas pocket
  while wearing a mask.

  tunnels in the sewers. The sewage floats above the bridge near the top of the
  screen.

  - unknown number > random thug, busy or no answer

- Saying "(Fuck, crap)" will hang up immediately.
  - To marie, she will take that as 'yes' for the dinner date.

** BUGS:
1.001.000: Even though Marie 'appears' to hang up on Sonny, the phone call
           carries on, unless Sonny forcibly hangs up the phone, giving him
           as many chances to say 'no' as he wants to until he ultimately
           says yes.

J1.000.052: After finishing the conversation with Al Lowe, he never hangs up.

            The random thug keeps repeating "Hhhhhhhhh" twice, no matter what
            Sonny says (In hiragana, he actually says "Ha-a...")  He never
            hangs up on the player.

            There is also a weird bug where the parser does not refresh and
            the previous command is still in the box.

    - 5 & 10: This is for Cotton Cove and Warehouse
      - When you enter the car, the current timer is set to 3 seconds (which
        means, no matter where you try to go, you will always get in trouble).
      - If the player is on the 1st timer, the 2nd one is set to 600.
    - 8: Pre-Warehouse
      - Since Sonny starts in his vehicle, being in it does not affect the 600
        timer. Driving somewhere, however, sets it to 10, meaning the player
        gets into trouble no matter what happens. Fortunately, this merely sets
        the 1st timer to 600 and this can be done without consequence.
    - All others
      - If the player gets in trouble with the captain on the 1st timer, no
        timer will set afterwards, giving the player free reign to do whatever
        they want until the current scenario has been completed.

pic.666 -- Cotton Cove, Van (script.066)

- Drawing your gun has the game telling you to calm down.
- You can prematurely exit the van, giving you only the bare minimuum of
  equipment, but be unable to stay underwater for any length of time.

** COMMANDS:
- look window

** BUGS:
- In the description, there are spots for where equipment is stated to be. If
  Sonny has picked up said pieces of equipment, spaces are left in their place.

-- EXTRAS

Speed Setting

- In 1.001.000, there is no ability to manually adjust the speed value. You can
  use + and - to change it up and down and use = to set it to 6, which appears
  to be the default value.
- In 1.001.006, the new 'SET SPEED' is bugged: It does not come included with
  a current value in the input (It is listed above) and if left empty, the game
  will set the speed to 1.
- This is fixed by the Amiga, JP and 1.002.011 versions where an existing value
  is included in the input. Also, if you try to remove the value and submit an
  empty field, the speed will remain unchanged.

Walkie talkie
- "Hand held transmitter/reciever"..

Game Introduction
- A new problem was created in 1.024 (and is carried over to J1.000.052 and
  1.002.011). The updates to the animation speed ended up tying the game
  introduction to computer cycles rather than the SCI0 timer, leading to a much
  faster game introduction. This can cause a number of glitches to appear
  on the opening, depending on fast the system is, such as entire background
  pieces floating into other background pieces and off the screen.
