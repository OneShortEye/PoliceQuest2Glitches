===============================================================================

------------ INTRODUCTION --------------

"Police Quest II: A well-thought out adventure game created by Sierra Online.
(At least by what we would define as well-thought out when we consider titles
such as moon logic King's Quest and horny logic Leisure Suit Larry). You, the
player, assume the role of Sonny Bonds, a veteran police officer and recently 
promoted detective of the Lytton PD. A year has passed since Sonny brought 
down the famous Death Angel (who was really just an overrated drug pusher that
had a mancrush for blonde pimps), hooked up with his favourite prostitute, I 
mean, girlfriend Marie Wilkans, and was enjoying life... Then, Bains broke out
of jail to ensure another Police quest game was created.  Way to go Bains. You
helped Walls score another hard-earned paycheque.

Generally well-received and liked (as far as Police Quest games go), we
suggested that SQH denizen Kuro-chan should have 'fun' while playing this 
game. Well.. that was a mistake, because he broke the fuck out of it!"

-------- GENERAL INFORMATION -----------

- This is aimed for lesser-known details. It is possible gamers may already
  know about some (if not all) of this content.
- Kuro-chan is responsible for finding nearly all the content.  A few entries
  were also found by Space Quest Historian and Sierra Arts, but were further
  researched (such as which versions had the glitch, additional in-game
  consequences, etc.).
- Room data will contain commentary on lesser known actions, odds and ends
  commands that may not be as well-known, potential softlocks you have to go
  out of your way to accomplish and a list of bugs that can do silly stuff,
  lock and even break the game.
- For some reason, 'dos' is a swear word.  Obviously, the development team
  missed making games for Apples.
- You can (sometimes) answer with affirmative / y for yes and n / negative for
  no.

-------- DIFFERENT SOUND JINGLE --------

- There is an unused sound track which the JP version of the game uses when the
  player scores points. In the resource files, it's sound.049

------------ DRIVER TIMERS -------------

- First countdown starts at 700 seconds and gradually goes down to 1. When you
  enter Homicide (while it's at 1), the 1st assignment gets triggered and the
  counter is set to 300 seconds (which is already counting down while the
  captain gives you your orders (By the time he's done talking, you'll have
  lost nearly 15 seconds).

  This timer can be sped up in two ways:
  - Driving around in your vehicle accelerates how quickly this depletes.
  - Sighting your gun and collecting the field kit sets the value to 1.

- Each of these events will set the timer to 5 minutes, giving the player that
  much in-game time to get there.
   - Go to Jail
   - Go to Mall
   - Go to Cotton Cove
   - Return to Cotton Cove (IF you pursued Bains)
   - Go to Warehouse **

** Warehouse one is a little different. Day 2 starts with a 10-minute countdown
   to give the player enough time to get into the Homicide office where the
   captain gives his orders to get your butt down to the Warehouse, THEN the
   5-minute counter starts.

- When the game first boots up The driver timer set to 700 and counts down the
  same way as starting a new game.

- If you wish to maniuplate the driver timers to see some unique glitches and
  bugs, do the following:
  - Enter debug mode (double-shift and minus on the far right side). This will
    pause the game, so do not feel rushed during this.
  - Press G for global variables
  - Type in 158 for the 1st variable and set it to 0.
  - Press G for global variables
  - Type in 159 for the 2nd variable and set it to 0.
  - Enter double-shift + D to exit debug mode and resume your game.

  If you set these both to 0, the game will ignore the timers and let you
  proceed to where you are going unhindered.

-------------- INVENTORY ---------------

- What flowers Sonny has purchased at the airport will show up differently in
  inventory.
- The checkmark on the hit list is ... backwards?

- Driving anywhere (in sonnymobile) while a timer is counting down will cause
  the timer to greatly accelerate. There are also instances where getting into
  the sonnymobile will knock the regular timer down to 5 or less, which will
  quickly expire the existing timer, landing the player in serious trouble.

----------- NAME SUBSTITUTES -----------

office       barn
field kit    briefcase
marie        cheeks
toilet       crapper


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   LOCATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pic.001 -- Station, Outside

- The game starts you off with no flags set (aside from whatever 'starts' the
  game), 0 points and a 700-second countdown before the Captain gives you your
  first orders. This timer is automatically set to 0 after the gun has been
  sighted and the field kit has been collected. If the player is worried they
  may not have enough time to earn all the possible points at the station
  before the timer runs out, consider doing those two events last. The next
  timer only starts AFTER the player walks back into Homicide and gets his
  orders from the captain.
- The flag does not animate in the JP version of the game.
- If the player waits long enough on this screen without any keys, a message
  will pop up having Sonny ask himself, "Now where are my keys?".

** COMMANDS:
   - look time
   - salute flag
   - look mirror

** BUGS:
   - The Moonwalking glitch can be done at the office. To perform this, the
     player must press a directional key as the game loads between the in-
     vehicle screen and the location screen as Sonny gets out of the car. If
     done right, the player will start to move in a direction, regardless of
     which way he is facing, which can result in an unusual 'moonwalking'-like
     appearance. Unlike other rooms, the player can walk into walls.
     This was (mostly) fixed by version 1.002.011. It is still possible to do
     this at the office using Sonny's personal vehicle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.002 -- Station, Main Hallway

(One of the rare, few instances where nothing is broken or unexpected commands
are found)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.003 -- Station, Narcotics

- There are plenty of words that can be used to earn points and interfere
  with an internal investagtion regarding Lloyd's druge use. Some of these
  work together better than others. These (appear to) include:

  verb1:  chat, converse, interrupt, speak, talk, ask, inquire, request
  verb2:  cocaine, dope, drug, narcotic, complaint, difficulty, problem,
          trouble, investigation

  This also requires the player has been on the computer and has accessed
  the personnel file.
- The cabinet in the back can give you access to the narcotics files, which
  happen to include Don Colby's address (even though it's listed as classified
  on the computer... Seriously, was anyone paying attention when they put
  this game together?!)
- You can say a LOT of different things to Kim Walters, even some odd words,
  like "(Kiss, fuck, hug, get, touch, take, steal, *many other words) + woman".
  Each response just rolls off her.
- Talking to Steve will allow him to recite one of his many poetry entries
  that he made up. You can also ask for a poem (No, please don't. Seriously,
  don't do it).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.004 -- Station, Homicide

- If you fail to hang up your keys after you are done your shift, the captain
  will instruct you to leave the keys on his desk. This process will repeat if
  you go back in to recover the keys.
- If you show up at the office between going to the hotel and going to Marie's,
  the Captain will comment on what happened at the hotel and what Bains may be
  after.
- After the Captain is made aware of Marie's kidnapping, if you bring up (or
  show) the hit list, the Captain will give you directions on what to do. If
  you have gathered enough evidence at the motel, he will direct you to chase
  down Colby before Bains kills him (which is where the idea of going to
  Steelton sorta comes from). Otherwise, he tells you to continue
  investigating. The funny part is: The hitlist is the item you need to
  'convince' the game that you have gathered enough evidence so you can book a
  flight. Giving the captain the hit list also removes it from your inventory,
  preventing the player from achieving the full score.

COMMANDS:
  - ask, get orders

BUGS:
  - During Day 2, if the player has a conversation with the captain that
    overrides the usual conversation (with him giving orders to go to the
    Warehouse). The only way for this to occur is for the player to visit
    Marie's house before they see the Captain. At that point, the player should
    access the phone (This does not work with the computer), then hang up. The
    captain will give his orders to go to the Warehouse, but Sonny is nowhere
    to be seen.
    This occurs in all versions of Police Quest II. In V.1.001.000, Sonny will
    float across the screen during the conversation with the Captain (after
    using the phone).
    This situation cannot occur under normal circumstances, given how the game
    bugs out on the timer as soon as Sonny tries to drive to Marie's house
    after he arrives at the station. To fix this, enter debug mode immediately
    after the window background changes to driving through town (You only have
    half a second to work with, give or take, so this has to be done quickly)
    and fix the driver timers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.005 -- Station, Locker Room

- Once in the stall, the usual routine of foul language becomes less of an
  issue.
  - use + (bathroom, lavatory, restroom crapper, shitter, stool, toilet,
    urinal, crapper)
  - leak, pee, piss, urinate, crap, defecate, dump, fart, poop, shit

  If you try any other combinations, you will get the usual 'bad language'
  response. There are additional actions you can take while in the stall:
  - pull down jeans
  - shake + (cock, dick, prick)
  - wipe (ass, butt, rear, tail)
  - flush + (crapper, shitter, stool, toilet, urinal)

  And yes, the flush verb is connected to a different set of nouns compared
  to the use verb.

** COMMANDS:
   - crawl under stall
   - knock
   - talk cop
   - bath hand, face
   - drink water
   - find locker

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.006 -- Station, Burglary

- Sonny gets another chance at being a playboy.

** COMMANDS:
   - ask serial number (after motel incident)
   - talk holt (was holt her original name?)
   - kiss, pinch, fuck woman
   - empty garbage

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.008 -- Station, Computer

** COMMANDS:
   - look book, instruction, cocksucker
   - exit, walk, go, quit, logout, bye

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.009 -- Station, Locker

- Handcuffs are also referred to as "arrest".
- Gun is also referred to as "9mm, gunbelt".

** COMMANDS:
   - kiss flyer, pinup, poster, button, buzzer (picture of Marie)
   - get flyer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.010 -- Station, Shooting Gallery

- "ep" is short for ear protectors.
- The counter is also called a "bookcase" and "coatrack".

** COMMANDS:
   - check, display gun
   - give, gave 9mm

** BUGS:
   - Repeatedly pressing PgUp/PgDown (Or 7/9 with the numeric pad) will cause
     Sonny's arms to move beyond the usual maximum vertical range giving them
     the impression they are floating in the air.
     This glitch does not appear 1.001.000, but was introduced in 1.002.011 and
     is carried into JP1.000.052.
   - Raising Sonny's arms to fire his gun at the target while the target is
     moving will result in the arms moving at a slow pace.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.011 -- Station, Shooting Gallery

- If you try to fire the gun while it is not up and the target is riddled with
  holes, you are told to replace the target, rather than die.
- You can (safely) fire five times without hearing protection on. For a low-
  score run, this is more than enough room to ensure you can sight the gun.
  The sixth shot is game over.
- Enter in "View" while the target is halfway and the game will tell you that
  the target is 'as close as it will get'.

** COMMANDS:
   - Adjust target, bullseye

** BUGS:
   - The infamous "Arms hovering in the air" glitch can be found here. To
     achieve this, keep pressing the diagonal keys "Numpad 7 & 9" or "Home &
     PageUp" until the arms start to float up. They can be floated above and
     outside the game window.
   - If you raise arms while the target is moving, the arms will move up a LOT
     SLOWER...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.013 -- Unmarked Car Interior
- Talking to Keith forces him to bring up his bad habit of smoking.
- If you type 'drive to murder' or 'drive to death' on the start of day 2, you
  are taken to the warehouse. Otherwise, you get Keith saying there are no
  murders to follow up on.
- There are various places from PQ1 you can type in as places to go, but you
  cannot visit them. The game cites them as places that no longer exist. These
  include: Caffeine Castle, Hotel Delphoria, Blue Chamber and Drunk Willie.
- Driving to 5556 fig ave. will give the response "You have hotter leads to
  follow". This remains unexplained.
- Restaurant goes by "Arnie", "Date", and "Chow"

** COMMANDS:
   - draw gun

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.014 -- Airport, Parking Lot

- If you examine the inside of the car after radioing for a tow truck, Keith
  will say he'll radio one in after leaving the screen (this is repeated so
  long as the player keeps examining the vehicle before it's towed away)

   - The animation for opening the sliding door has an incorrect transparency
     color. When it first opens, a bright purple briefly shows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.016 -- Airport, Entrance

- This is one of the locations where Sonny can behave like a playboy.
- There is a whole list of places you 'could' buy a ticket to:
  - america, angeles, bangkok, boston, california, chicago, china, detroit,
    diego, england, france, francisco, hawaii, honolulu, italy, japan, korea,
    las, london, mars, mexico, mississippi, moon, moscow, nashville, nevada,
    nicaragua, north, paris, peking, philadelphia, philly, rome, russia, san,

    washington, york, yosemite
  The only places you 'can' buy a ticket to are: Houston, Steelton, Beirut,
  Coarsegold and America. The only places you can complete a transaction to
  are: Houston and Steelton.
- If the player discovers Bains booked a flight to Houston, there is an option
  to try and pursue Bains by booking a flight to Houston as well.

  that cannot be done, here.
- There will be a guy in the bathroom on Day 2.

** COMMANDS:
   - look mirror
   - read graffiti (in a stall)
   - drink water
   - leak,crap (while not in a stall)
   - frisk,search tank (allows you to skip a step)
   - smell odor.
   - look dude, gentleman, marshal
   - look dirt.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.020 -- Airport, Security

- The player can draw their gun AFTER getting past the security checkpoint.
- In an unusual scene, showing Bains' mugshot ellicits a generic 'no one
  recognizes the mugshot' comment.
- If you walk up and down the gate enough times, the guard will start to
  comment on it.
- The security guard's reaction to the player's gun starts getting odd when
  the player is beyond the metal detector:
   - The guard only notices the gun drawn along the left half of the screen
     and (mostly) below the metal detector, though being close to the guard
     will also trigger his response.

** COMMANDS:
   - look floor, ceiling
   - look jerk (near Larry)
   - get, cut, break rope
   - arrest Larry
   - show gun / kill guard (save first)
      - You can do this on the other side of the guard (show badge first, then
        walk past the metal detector). This makes for a more entertaining game
        over. This can only be done near the guard.
   - F8
      - The guard will only react if you do this along the bottom half of the
        screen, below the metal detector

** BUGS:
   - No matter where the player is shot on the screen, Sonny will always appear
     along the bottom middle, in front of the metal detector.
   - Purchase a pair of tickets to somewhere, get rid of Keith, then attempt to
     board the airplane. The game throws the player an "oops" since it
     (normally) calls for Keith to follow the player.
     This was fixed by version 1.002.011 (The game claims you missed the flight
     while Keith is MIA).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.022 -- Jail, outside

- The 'driving' timer is still counting down. So long as Sonny does not re-
  enter the vehicle when it hits 1, it is a non-issue.
- When pushing the buzzer, you can respond with (yes, y, affirmative) or (no,
  n).

** COMMANDS:
   - look friend
   - look cruiser
   - look jailer
   - call, holler friend
   - exit auto
   - knock
   - let i
   - acquire in
   - unlock door
   - close door
   - throw gun
   - use extender

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.023 -- Jail, inside

- The 'driving' timer is set to 0 after Sonny leaves the jail. This only
  applies when the jail is the current objective.
- If the player brings the gun inside, the game removes the gun from inventory.
  When leaving the jail, the gun is returned and $5 is removed from the money
  clip (if there is $5).
- If the player brings the field kit inside, the kit is taken away from the
  player and returned upon leaving.

** COMMANDS:
   - look down, up
   - look wall
   - ask, take, give, replace, get gun
   - open cell, cage
   - talk jailer
   - talk dude
   - open door

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.024 -- Airplane, dispenser (script.042)

- You can try to 'take' the bomb (for a game over, of course).

** COMMANDS:
   - get towel
   - use bracket
   - disarm bomb
   - look timer
   - pull, bite  --  cable, wire
   - eat bomb

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.025 -- Motel parking lot

- This entire section is entirely optional: It CAN be skipped.
- If the player tries to 'ask' for a warrant, they get the message they should
  call disptach.
- An alternate to showing the mugshot is to mention the name "Bill Cole"
  (Which is on the envelope corner you get from Woody). You will get the info
  and the points.
- An alternate way of trying to enter the motel room is to 'kick the door'
  (like those old police shows), but since there is no way to evade the trap,
  this will always kill Sonny.
- Evading the trap door (while trying to open it) causes the "Gun Sighted"
  flag to reset back to 0. There is a casual mention of Sonny slamming his
  hand along the wall as this event happens. If the player skips the motel
  section, there is no need to reset the gun sights prior to the airplane trip.
- If the player returns to the motel after the incident has concluded, they
  will find the motel door boarded up, area taped off and an officer on standby
  to prevent Sonny from going inside, again.
- If the player ditches Keith partway through the motel incident, the game
  crashes when they unload tear gas into the room.

** COMMANDS:
   - look watch
   - ask warrant
   - arrest dude
   - ask chamber
   - return key
   - give cash
   - dude cole, bains
   - get browning (face your trunk, does not work with sonnymobile)
   - talk friend
   - open police
   - police
   - go pane
   - look door (After it's blown open)
   - kick door (not just Room 108)

** BUGS:
   - In v1.001.000, standing on the spot where the officer who delivers a
     warrant appears will cause the AI to frantically circle around the player
     for a couple seconds, then suddenly stop and lock the game. Players can
     still access the menu, save, restore, etc., but will be unable to continue
     the current game. This was fixed in later versions.
   - The range for sonny being able to enter the unmarked vehicle is unually
     large (vertically); the event can be triggered as high up the screen as
     Sonny being right in front of the stairs leading to the 2nd floor of the
     motel.
   - The door animation is misaligned when Sonny 'kicks it down' instead of
     opening it with the motel key.
   - Attempting to get the Browning shotgun out of the trunk before Keith
     grabs it will tell the player Sonny should not remove it from the trunk...
     even though it's not there.
   - The Moonwalking glitch can be done at the motel. To perform this, the
     player must press a directional key as the game loads between the in-
     vehicle screen and the location screen as Sonny gets out of the car. If
     done right, the player will start to move in a direction, regardless of
     which way he is facing, which can result in an unusual 'moonwalking'-like
     appearance. Unlike other rooms, the player can walk into walls.
     This was fixed by v1.002.011.
   - Not having Keith and attempting to open the door (with the key) while
     backup is there will throw an "oops" and end the game.
     This glitch was introduced in 1.002.011 and is carried into JP1.000.052.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.026 -- Motel, inside

** COMMANDS:
   - get browning (more interesting if Keith is not with you)
   - get television (top side bed)
   - lie, nap, sat
   - turn card (after getting it)
   - wash hands
   - flush toilet
   - acquire crap

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.027 -- Warehouse

- The event is not set until after the player talks to the captain on Day 2. If
  the player drives there immediately after day 2 starts, they will find
  nothing.
- Driving here in Sonny's car will result in the game crashing (Since it would
  normally call for Keith to start walking around the screen, except there is
  no Keith)
- You can get the blood and camera shots before moving in for a close-up of the
  trunk.

** COMMANDS:
   - drink blood (eww...)
   - frisk, look in car (lol)
   - get hair, dirt
   - make cast
   - look broad
   - look car (at woody's car)
   - look white car
   - look coroner
   - n
   - look hole
   - read sign
   - climb
   - check registration
   - crawl hole

** BUGS:
   - The Moonwalking glitch can be done at the motel. To perform this, the
     player must press a directional key as the game loads between the in-
     vehicle screen and the location screen as Sonny gets out of the car. If
     done right, the player will start to move in a direction, regardless of
     which way he is facing, which can result in an unusual 'moonwalking'-like
     appearance. The player can float into the sky and beyond.
     This was fixed by v1.002.011.
   - There is a bug where if the timer hits 0 after Dispatch's final message
     is displayed (this ie just before the screen changes over to the
     warhouse), the event will not trigger. Instead, Keith simply gets out of
     the car, walks into the fence and asks (with a textbox that is 1/3 out of
     the screen) if they are meeting someone. Under regular circumstances,
     trying to time this would be next to impossible; it would be a lot
     easier to use debug mode and set 158 to 1 as you get the dispatch
     message.
   - Not bringing Keith along causes a crash. Immediately after Sonny gets out
     of the car, officer Gelepsi begins his recounting of what happened.
     Partway through the game throws the player an "oops".
     This occurs in all versions of Police Quest II, however, it cannot be
     performed under normal circumstances. This requires the player to enter
     debug mode (after entering the sonnymobile) and reset the driver timer
     variables before driving off.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** COMMANDS:
  - drink blood

  - get newspaper (after body is gone)

pic.030 -- Arnie's Inside

- Many of the innapropriate words "eat, fuck, hump, screw, blow, suck" can be
  used on Marie.
- You can try to 'fuck patron', but it goes about as well as expected.
- Kissing patron/customer is not allowed, it seems. Instead, you get a
  generic response.
- Do NOT enter the smoking section.
- 1/2 price menu IF the player shows Sonny's badge to the waiter. This changes
  three values in memory to reflect the prices.
- If you want, you can stand up after taking the orders and leave the
  restaurant.
- The restaurant has (what appears to be) 2 timers for events. The timer seems
  to work at around 10 frames per second at normal speed.
  - Arrive: 1500, Timer 1
    - If you do not find Marie and sit down by this point, you get the "Not in
      the mood" message and the event ends.
    - If this hits zero and Sonny has sat down with Marie, he will comment on
      how such a romantic evening has got his appetite going. This resets
      the counter to 1500 and continues to repeat until Sonny has eaten.
    - If this hits zero and Sonny has eaten, but has not kissed Marie, he will
      comment on wanting 'romantic time' with Marie.
    - If this hits zero, and Sonny has kissed Marie, the event ends. Eating
      does not affect the outcome.
  - Sit down with Marie: 100, Timer 2
    - The waiter arrives and takes your order.
    - There does not seem to be any additional timer that can mess up this
      process.
  - Order Taken: 300, Timer 3, 450, Timer 4. Once Timer 3 runs out, Timer 4
    starts.
  - Timers 3 and 4 reach zero: Order is delivered.

pic.031 -- Marie's House, Outside

** COMMANDS:
   - look house
   - look tree, bush, lawn, grass, flower
   - look ave, sidewalk, driveway
   - look up, down, air, dirt, roof
   - look bains
   - look sweet cheeks
   - climb fence
   - police (to door)
   - break window

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.032 -- Marie's House, Inside

- Player can search the chair and sofa and find $3, adding it to your money
  clip. This can be done at any point in the game, prior to departing for
  Steelton.
- On Day 2, the game allows the player to search Marie's house on their own
  without having Keith around (Player can drive their own vehicle to Marie's).
  The game was setup to handle this.

** COMMANDS:
   - look window
   - look grass
   - look clock
   - call friend (by yourself)
   - turn on lamp

** BUGS:
   - In Marie's house, the ashtray can be dusted and prints collected. These
     prints use the same inventory item as the prints collected from the
     jailer's car. On top of it, there is nothing in the game that tracks that
     these prints have been collected. Since evidence counts for one point each
     when booked, the player can (without limit) go to Marie's house, pick up
     the prints and bring them back to the station to earn a point, up to a
     maximum of 32767 before the value loops back and becomes a negative
     number.
     This was fixed by version 1.002.011 (It is no longer possible to get
     prints at the house).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.033 -- Sonny's vehicle.

- Driving anywhere while the timer is counting down will cause the timer to run
  5 times (approx.) faster than normal.
- Do not enter this vehicle while under orders to investgate Cotton Cove and
  the Warehouse.  Doing these will set the driver timer to 3.  If you are on
  your first timer, it will also set the second timer to 600.  When that happens,
  no matter where you go, you will get in trouble back at the station.

** SOFTLOCK:
  - There is a nasty softlock that can take place IF the player waits around
    10-11 minutes, THEN drives somewhere (without opening the door to the car
    at least once).  If the player waits long enough, Sonny will get pulled
    over, taken back to the station, given the usual lecture, then gets his
    orders to go to jail. However, during this, the game will not take the
    keys from the ignotion and the personal car door remains locked.  This will
    prevent Sonny from entering the office and going back to his car to
    complete Day 1, resulting in said softlock.
    This happens in all versions of Police Quest II.

** COMMANDS:
   - look back bench
   - adjust
   - use extender
   - buckle
   - turn on heat, air, conditioner, fan
   - look visor
   - look ashtray
   - press horn
   - turn on/off engine
   - drive death (works for warehouse)

** BUGS:
  - Doing the "Don't enter personal vehicle on day 2 while under orders" and
    trying to drive somewhere with the vehicle will result in unique
    disciplinary dialogue where the captain will suspend Sonny "again" for
    disobeying orders...  even though he was not suspended the first time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.040 -- Airplane, cabin

- If you board with a ticket to Houston, you can go through the usual start,
  then you are escorted off the plane, since there is no need to go there. For
  lulz, you can also say 'no' when asked if you are Detective Bonds during the
  process.
- This is one of the locations where Sonny can behave like a playboy.

** COMMANDS:
   - open compartment
   - look window
   - pinch attendant
   - kiss, fuck -- naked, boob, sex

** BUGS:
   - There is a small window during the hijacking after the stewardess falls on
     the floor where if Sonny draws his gun and fires right before the hijacker
     attacks Sonny, the bullet hit will register too late and the hijacker's
     kill animation begins, killing the player, instead. Given there is no
     unique circumstance for this, the player is told they missed because the
     gun was not sighted, even if it is.
     This was fixed by version 1.002.011 (Sonny's bullet registers a kill much
     faster and the game prevents the player from firing once the hijacker
     performs his kill animation).
   - You can talk to the hijackers after Sonny guns them down. They have
     generic passenger responses (By this point, all the pasengers are scared
     since there is a bomb set to blow them up any second).
   - In JP1.000.052, Keith disappears while the hijackers make their
     appearance. After they have been taken out and the stewardess returns to
     the cabin, Keith appears once again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.050 -- Airport, stolen vehicle (script.104)

- "Read (VIN, Badge)" will give the player 1 point if they do/did not look at
  the license plate.

** COMMANDS:
   - look airplane

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.060 -- Cotton cove (middle)

- There is a small window after the shootout where the player can enter 'halt'
  for Sonny to order Bains to stop. This starts once Bains starts shooting and
  ends when the vehicle arrives.
- Sonny appears a few more pixels to the right when entering from the right
  in v1.002.011.

** COMMANDS:
   - look behind tree
   - look lake
   - look under bush
   - look clue, evidence, blood, mark, footprint, feet print
   - look heart
   - halt, freeze, police (bains)
   - look bains (after shooting)
   - apprehend, pursue, chase bains
   - look plate (getaway vehicle)
   - change clothes
   - find certificate

** BUGS:
   - Getting hit by the Bainsmobile without Keith around locks the game.
     This appears in 1.001.000 and 1.002.011. This cannot happen in the JP
     version since the car scene is unused on this screen.
     This cannot be performed under normal circumstances, given that entering
     the sonnymobile while under orders to investigate short changes the
     driver timer so you end up with almost nothing left. To fix this, enter
     debug mode and set the driver timers AFTER you climb in the sonnymobile
     so you can travel to Cotton Cove without any problems.
   - During the shootout, if Sonny's fires during Bains' final shot, he will
     manage to escape, but Sonny will 'start' to fall to ground from a fatal
     wound, but stays in mid-air right up to the 'game over' screen.
     This occurs in all versions of Police Quest II, though in versions past
     1.001.000, the death animation will complete, not leave the player hanging
     in the air.
   - If the player is hit at the very edge of the screen by the Bainsmobile,
     the vehicle will drive off, back up into the middle of the screen, then
     drive off again. Keith will get off his comment about who is driving the
     vehicle, then the game freezes.
     This is partially fixed by version 1.002.011. The glitch can still happen,
     though it is unlikely the player will see the vehicle backing up. This
     cannot happen in the JP version since and the car scene is unused on this
     screen.
   - If the player is firing the gun while the van with Officer Moore inside
     arrives, different events can happen:
     - In version 1.001.000, Sonny will put away his gun as the van arrives and
       the game freezes with no way to access the menu, exit the game, etc.
     - In version 1.002.011 and JP1.000.052, Sonny will have an unusual pose
       while facing the approaching van and the game will lock up. The rest of
       the scene with Moore exiting the vehicle will play out, but the only
       thing the player can do is access the menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.061 -- Cotton cove (right)

- This is one of the locations where Sonny can behave like a playboy.
- The driving timer is set to 0 as soon as you pull in (current objective).
- While the dialogue for it has always been in the game since 1.001.000, the
  scripting in script.061 was edited in 1.002.011 to include the option to ask
  officer Gelepsi to call a Coroner on your behalf. While it sets the same flag
  as radioing the call, yourself, it awards the player the wrong amount of
  points and can lead to a score that exceeds the game's normal 300 limit. This
  glitch does not appear 1.001.000, but was introduced in 1.002.011 and is
  carried into JP1.000.052.
- After the shootout, you can enter the car and either radio in the incident
  or you can pursue/chase bains. Both award the same points. If you ignore
  the captain's calls to return to Cotton Cove to investigate, you will be
  taken to the Airport (where there is no black car, yet).

** COMMANDS:
   - affirmative, yes, y
   - negative, no, n
   - look initials
   - close door
   - use phone
   - smell garbage
   - enter
   - look plank (good luck finding it)
   - show, display (to blonde)
   - show, display  --  clue, evidence, blood, footprint, feet print, i
   - ask name
   - ask address, license, badge (especially more than once)
   - ask date, number
   - interrogate, ask
   - calm girl
   - look blood, mark, clue, evidence
   - fuck, feel, eat, kiss girl

** BUGS:
   - If the player is run over by the Bainsmobile on the far screen, the player
     will get the caption for when they win the game, then the game over
     screen, allowing the player to restart/restore/quit.
     This occurs in all versions of Police Quest II.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.062 - Cotton cove (left)

- You can follow Bains as he flees from Sonny.
- This is one of two screens where Sonny can get run over by the Bainsmobile.
- If the player is hit by the vehicle, the player will get a "Thank you for
  playing Police Quest 2" then a proper game over. On this screen, Jim says
  something slightly different, "Don't worry, though; Keith will explain in his
  report how he herocially 'watched your back'." . The obvious change is the
  inclusion of 'though'.
- There is a unique game over on this screen if the player is hit by the
  Bainsmobile and Keith is not present.

** COMMANDS:
   - look behind tree
   - look under bush
   - look clock
   - smell

** BUGS:
   - There is a priority vs control misalignment where Sonny can clip through
     between the two rocks on the mid-right side of the screen.
   - The rock along the upper right corner can be clipped through to reach the
     mid-right side of the screen after the player gets the warning about the
     rocks being a tight fit.

pic.067 -- Oak Tree Mall

- You can look up the VIN number on the stolen car, but not on Pate's vehicle...
- "Look license" and "Read license" gives you different responses.
- The driving counter is set to 0 as soon as you pull in (current objective).
- You can ask the lady a number of different things, such as her name, number,
  address, etc., but all she will tell you about is her car (Sounds like she
  might have issues).
- After your business is concluded and you wait long enough in the car, if you
  exit, the cop, lady and 2 vehicles will be gone.

pic.076 -- Sewer Control Room Entrance (script.

** COMMANDS:
   - open door

   There are plenty of vocab bundles where saying a word is the same as looking
   around. These include (but are hardly limited to):
     - leak, pee, urinate, piss, crap, defecate, dump, fart, poop, shit, fuck
     - barf, vomit
     - beat, hit, kick, punch, slap, stome, strike
     - arrest, bust, cuff, handcuff
     - exit, leave
     - saw

   - remove mask
   - smell
   - listen
   - push button
   - use control
   - look gauge
   - loon control panel
   - *anything marie, cheeks
   - up close

** BUGS:
   - Ordering Bains to "HALT" will cause him to stop and shoot wherever he
     stands, forcing the player to shoot at him immediately to prevent him from
     killing Sonny. The player can start firing back and kill Bains
     immediately. The cutscene will start to play, but without Bains in the
     proper spot for Sonny to walk over to the body, the game locks up.
     If the player waits until Bains start shooting to tell him to "HALT"
     (assuming Sonny has taken a proper hiding position), this will not affect
     the cutscene, at all.
     Yelling at Bains to stop appears to reset the counter on the number of
     shots fired at Sonny before he kills him.
     This can be used to interrupt Bains' easy kill should the player be out of
     position and not ready to attack. However, this will still lock the game.
     Bains will not change direction and will continue to fire at the pipe
     Sonny (normally) hides behind during the shootout. This still counts
     towards the number of shots needed to kill Sonny, regardless of where in
     the room he is standing (even behind Bains).
     Sonny can leave the room, but since the script outside the room is not
     updated with Bains being inside the room, a second Bains will show up and
     gun Sonny down.
     This occurs in all versions of Police Quest II.

** BUGS:
   - The punk can get stuck along the upper part of the screen, running around,
     unable to escape. Eventually, the punk disappears.
     This is found in all versions of Police Quest II.
   - If the player is on one side of the lower bush and the thug is on the
     other and calls up Keith, Sonny is scripted to move to a position, but is
     path blocked, which prevents the rest of the script from being executed.
     This will lock the game, aside from accessing the menu.
     This is found in all versions of Police Quest II.

** BUGS:

   Where to begin...

   - A (partial) out-of-bounds glitch can happen under a set of circumstances:
     - The player climbs the ladder, attempts to move the cover, then climbs
       back down.

       AND

       The player draws out the gun and fires it as Bains enters the room. If
       the player is firing as Bains enters the room to fire at Sonny, the
       animation set will be stuck at the player drawing their weapon as they
       move around the room while ignoring pathing walls/blockers. The player
       can still exit the room, but they will be no longer able to fire their
       weapon (So whatever you do, do not attempt to finish the game or save
       your progress after completing this glitch). To fix the glitch, the
       player must withdraw their gun before leaving the room.

       OR

       The player falls into the water. If timed right and Bains approaches and
       fires before Sonny completely falls in, he will animate and splash
       around the entire room. However, this prevents all map exits from
       running properly, leaving the player trapped.

     This was fixed by version 1.002.011 (Bains no longer shows up while Sonny
     fires his gun or falls into the sewer muck).

   - After rattling the manhole cover and climbing back down, should the player
     climb up the manhole, Bains will still show up, kill the player and leave.
     Sonny's dead body is left badly positioned and clipping into the wall.
     This was fixed by version 1.002.011 (Bains no longer shows up while Sonny
     is up the ladder).
   - Attempting to shoot your gun in a methane pocket while the gas mask is on
     will softlock the game. Menu options are still accessible.
     This happens in all versions of the game.
   - On the left side of the sewer is a methane pocket that spans two screens.
     Moving from the middle left screen to the upper left screen will cause the
     mask to disappear if the gun has been drawn. The mask is still
     'technically' on, but the wrong sprite is being used.
     On a side note: This glitch will allow a player to shoot a methane gas
     pocket while wearing a mask.
     This happens in all versions of the game.
   - The transparency color was not properly set for most of the animation
     frames when Sonny draws his gun while wearing a gas mask.
     This is in versions 1.001.000 and 1.002.011, but was fixed for
     JP1.000.052.
   - The sewage floats above the bridge near the top of the screen. This
     applies to both the upper left and lower left screens in the sewer.
     This is in versions 1.001.000 and 1.002.011. In version JP1.000.052, they
     shifted the upper muck down a fair bit, but removed the bridge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pic.444 -- Using the Phone

- Some extra phone numbers:
   - 2096836858 - Al Lowe or Sierra On-Line customer support
   - 2096834463 - Requires a modem to connect to the BBS
   - unknownnumber - random thug, busy or no answer

- Saying "(Fuck, crap)" will hang up immediately.
   - To marie, she will take that as 'yes' for the dinner date.

** BUGS:
  V1.001.000: Even though Marie 'appears' to hang up on Sonny, the phone call
              carries on, unless Sonny forcibly hangs up the phone, giving him
              as many chances to say 'no' as he wants to until he ultimately
